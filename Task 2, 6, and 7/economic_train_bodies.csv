1,"Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk thinks the global economic decline could last for another year and a half. In a Twitter exchange early Friday morning Eastern time, the mercurial electric car executive and worlds richest man said a recession could continue until spring of 24. The remarks came in response to a tweet from Shibetoshi Nakamoto, the online name for Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who noted that current coronavirus numbers are actually pretty low. i [sic] guess all we have to worry about now is the impending global recession and nuclear apocalypse. It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event, Musk replied. Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a Twitter account with nearly 600,000 followers, then asked Musk how long he thought the recession would last, to which he replied, Just guessing, but probably until spring of 24. Global GDP grew 6% in 2021 but is expected to decelerate to 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. That would mark the weakest pace of growth since 2001 outside of the financial crisis in 2008 and the brief plunge in the early days of the Covid pandemic. The Federal Reserve projects GDP in the U.S. to grow just 0.2% this year and 1.2% in 2023. Musk becomes the latest corporate titan to express reservations about the economy. In a tweet Wednesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said its time to batten down the hatches in preparation for rough economic waters ahead. That tweet accompanied a video of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who said in a CNBC interview that he thinks theres a good chance of a recession in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also has been warning of economic turmoil ahead. Musks comment also came amid a rough week for Tesla stock as the automaker missed revenue estimates and cautioned about a potential delivery shortfall this year. During the analyst call, Musk expressed more confidence in the U.S. economy than other parts of the world. He also noted the impact that interest rate increases are having on the economy. The U.S. actually is in  North Americas in pretty good health, he said. A little bit of that is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think theyll eventually realize that and bring back down, I think. However, he said China is in quite a burst of a recession of sorts driven by the real estate market, while Europe has a recession of sorts, driven by energy."""
3,"The U.S. economy posted its first period of positive growth for 2022 in the third quarter, at least temporarily easing recession fears, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday. GDP, a sum of all the goods and services produced from July through September, increased at a 2.6% annualized pace for the period, according to the advance estimate. That was above against the Dow Jones forecast for 2.3%. That reading follows consecutive negative quarters to start the year, meeting a commonly accepted definition of recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research is generally considered the arbiter of downturns and expansions. The growth came in large part due to a narrowing trade deficit, which economists expected and consider to be a one-off occurrence that wont be repeated in future quarters. GDP gains also came from increases in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment and government spending. The report reflected an ongoing shift to services spending over goods, with spending on the former increasing 2.8% while goods spending dropped 1.2%. Declines in residential fixed investment and private inventories offset the gains, the BEA said. Overall, while the 2.6% rebound in the third quarter more than reversed the decline in the first half of the year, we dont expect this strength to be sustained, wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. Exports will soon fade and domestic demand is getting crushed under the weight of higher interest rates. We expect the economy to enter a mild recession in the first half of next year. Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data watch now VIDEO04:28 Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data Markets were higher following the release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 300 points in early trading on Wall Street. In other economic news Thursday, weekly jobless claims edged higher to 217,000 but were still below the 220,000 estimate. Also, orders for long-lasting goods increased 0.4% in September from the previous month, below the 0.7% expectation. The report comes as policymakers fight a pitched battle against inflation, which is running around its highest levels in more than 40 years. Price surges have come due a number of factors, many related to the Covid pandemic but also pushed by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus that is still working its way through the financial system. The underlying picture from the BEA report showed an economy slowing in key areas, particularly the consumer and private investment. Consumer spending as measured through personal consumption expenditures increased at just a 1.4% pace in the quarter, down from 2% in Q2. Gross private domestic investment fell 8.5%, continuing a trend after falling 14.1% in the second quarter. Residential investment, a gauge of homebuilding, tumbled 26.4% after falling 17.8% in Q2, reflecting a sharp slowdown in the real estate market. On the plus side, exports, which add to GDP, rose 14.4% while imports, which subtract, dropped 6.9%. Net exports of goods and services added 2.77 percentage points to the headline total, meaning GDP essentially would have been flat otherwise. There was some good news on the inflation front. The chain-weighted price index, a cost-of-living measure that adjusts for consumer behavior, rose 4.1% for the quarter, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 5.3% gain, due in large part to falling energy prices. Also, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 4.2%, down sharply from 7.3% in the prior quarter. Core prices, excluding food and energy, increased 4.5%, about in line with Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, the Fed began a campaign of interest rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Since March, the central bank has raised its benchmark borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, taking it to its highest level since just before the worst of the financial crisis. Those increases are aimed at slowing the flow of money through the economy and taming a jobs market where openings outnumber available workers by nearly 2 to 1, a situation that has driven up wages and contributed to a wage-price spiral that economists fear will tip the U.S. into recession. Our concerns about going into recession would not necessarily be from any of this data. It comes more from how much the Fed cranks up rates and what happens when firms and consumers respond to this, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. The most encouraging thing is you still have consumer spending, you still have job growth and wage growth and that should help on the consumer spending side, he added. What we would be most concerned about would be a sharp pullback by businesses in their hiring. The Fed is widely accepted to approve a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike at its meeting next week, but then might slow the pace of increases afterward as officials take time to assess the impact of policy on economic conditions. The Fed will continue to err on the side of overtightening, which is reasonable given the desire to mitigate the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at high levels, said Preston Caldwell, head of U.S. economics for Morningstar. After December, were likely to see the pace of tightening slow quite dramatically. Policymakers will get another, more current look at inflation data when the BEA releases a report Friday that will include personal consumption expenditures prices for September. That measure is expected to show that core prices excluding food and energy rose 5.2% from a year ago and 0.5% on a monthly basis."
4,"The Tatas are in talks with Lockheed Martin for manufacturing Sikorsky S-76 helicopter in India, according to reports. The S-76 is a medium-sized helicopter widely put to both civilian and military use in many countries. The armed forces of Britain, Japan, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Argentina use (or used earlier) it. Lockheed Martin, one of the world's biggest defence manufacturers, owns Sikorsky. The Tatas have a contract to make 40 C-295 transport aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The Indian government is aware of the discussions between the two, according to sources cited in the media. It is being seen as part of Modi government's Make in India for the World plan. Lockheed Martin and Tatas already are in a contract. The Tatas manufacture the wings for the F-16 fighter aircraft and components for the C-130 transport aircraft. If the deal goes through, it will be one of the biggest milestones for Indian aviation manufacturing. As per various reports, there are plans to sell Sikorsky helicopters not just in India but all over the world. Key aspects such as production numbers and project cost have yet to be worked out. According to sources cited by Times Now, ""there will be a considerable amount of indigenous content that will help smaller manufacturers of components."" It is likely to be a multi-billion dollar deal, the sources added. It may be noted that PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for the much-hyped Tata plant on Sunday in Vadodara. It will make the S-295 transport aircraft."
5,"The Commerce Department analysis found U.S. gross domestic product, a broad economic measure that tallies the value of finished goods and services produced across the nation, saw nominal growth over the last three months following declines in the first two quarters of the year. According to the report, the increase in real GDP reflects increases in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and private inventory investment. Does GDP growth mean a recession is off the table? Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, like what occurred in the U.S. in the first half of this year, is one of the bellwethers of the start of an economic recession. While a mixed set of factors helped drive overall economic growth in July-September, economists say the positive uptick is by no means a sign that recession worries are off the table. Consumer spending is down slightly, but it has remained surprisingly vibrant throughout the year and has helped bolster the economy, even as prices on goods and services have soared and the price of debt, like interest rates on carryover credit card balances and mortgage rates, have hit the highest levels in decades. A still robust U.S. jobs market has also functioned as a balancing factor against other, negative economic indicators Per a new report from The Associated Press, the outlook for the overall economy remains gloomy. The Fed has raised interest rates five times this year and is set to do so again next week and in December. Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that the Feds hikes will bring pain in the form of higher unemployment and possibly a recession. Looking ahead, risks are to the downside, to consumption in particular, as households continue to face challenges from high prices and likely slower job growth going forward, Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. Despite the swing in the headline GDP, conditions on the ground for consumers havent changed much, and concerns for an economic downturn remain, per CNN. I do think theres roughly a 50-50 probability of recession in 2023, Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. We are starting to see job growth slow; housing is becoming more of a drag; consumer spending growth, although thats holding up, is also slowing; and theres a potential that as interest rates move even higher through the rest of this year, that we could see a recession some time next year. The new Commerce Department report notes a price index in the GDP data rose at a 4.1% annual rate from July through September, down from 9% in the April-June period  less than economists had expected and the smallest increase since the final three months of 2020, according to The Associated Press. The latest inflation report from the U.S. Labor Department, released earlier this month, found the consumer price index rose 0.4% in September and was up 8.2% from a year ago. Mountain West states, including Utah, continued to see the highest regional inflation in the country in September, coming in at 9.6% up year over year. Cost increases in shelter, food and medical care were the largest contributors to the monthly uptick, according to the Department of Labor. While those costs were partly offset by a 4.9% decline in gas prices, food prices are continuing to rise up 0.8% from the month before. Energy prices fell 2.1% over the month along with gas prices, but natural gas and electricity costs increased. Year over year, energy prices increased 19.8% and food was up 11.2%."
6,"Indias economy grew at a record pace in the second quarter, even as the country grappled with a devastating wave of Covid-19. But Asias third largest economy isnt out of the woods yet and remains smaller than at the start of the pandemic. GDP rose 20.1% in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year earlier. The big jump reflects a rebound from the deep slump in activity in 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed one of the worlds toughest lockdowns on 1.3 billion people, restricting business and travel for months and plunging the country into its first recession in decades. The record year-on-year rise in Indian GDP in Q2 was due entirely to base effects, wrote Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics in a research note. This time last year, India posted a 24% fall in GDP. India had just begun to claw its way out of the slump earlier this year when a second wave of the coronavirus  believed by experts to have been sparked by the now-global Delta variant  engulfed the country. For weeks, India reported thousands of Covid-related deaths every day. Even as the infection rate spiraled, Modi resisted pressure to impose another national lockdown, a strategy intended to prevent millions of people from slipping back into poverty. That meant that even though the human cost of this springs outbreak was staggering, economic activity rebounded rapidly once cases started declining. Still, the second wave took its toll on the economy. India does not provide official quarter-on-quarter GDP data, but Capital Economics estimates that the economy shrank by 12% in the April-June period compared with the preceding three months. [This] contraction is very large by historic standards, and sharper than we had been anticipating, Shah added. Anagha Deodhar, chief economist at ICICI Securities, said Tuesdays annual growth figure was weaker than she was expecting. If you look at pre-pandemic levels, we are still a smaller economy by 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion), Deodhar told CNN Business, adding that manufacturing, agriculture and exports have done well for the country recently. Exports are driving growth mainly because global economy is recovering faster than the domestic one. Business activity has inched above pre-pandemic levels for the past three weeks, according to a Business Resumption Index compiled by Nomura, which tracks mobility indices, power demand and the labor force participation rate, among other metrics. There are other positive signs as well: Indias vaccination rate has picked up, with the country on track to fully vaccinate about half of the population by the end of the year, Nomura analysts said. But the economic recovery still faces threats over the next few months, as cases begin to rise again in the Southern Indian state of Kerala. The Nomura analysts said a potential third wave cannot be ruled out, especially with the festive Diwali season approaching."
9,"India's foreign exchange (forex) reserves declined $3.8 billion to $524.5 billion for the week ending October 21, data released by Reserve Bank of India on Friday showed. Reserves are at their lowest levels since July 2020. Since last year, reserves have declined by $115 billion. The primary reason for the decline is foreign currency assets, which recorded a dip of $3.5 billion to $465 billion. Value of gold held by the central bank declined $2.47 billion compared to October 14. Gold accounts for 7.1 per cent of India's total forex reserves. The RBI has been selling rupees to prevent a rapid depreciation. On October 21, the rupee depreciated 6 paise to a record low of 83.06 against the US dollar in opening trade due to a stronger greenback overseas and unrelenting foreign fund outflows. On October 27, the rupee and government bonds strengthened as weak economic data in the US sparked speculation of the Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its rate increases. The domestic currency settled at 82.50 per dollar as against 82.73 per dollar on Tuesday. So far in 2022, the Fed has raised interest rates by 300 bps in order to bring down US inflation, which has hovered around 40-year highs for many months. The US rate hikes have led to sweeping strength in the dollar, higher US bond yields and consequently reduced the appeal of assets in emerging markets such as India."
10,"Amidst the declining optimism towards emerging economies, Indias economic outlook remains positive. This is due to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led governments dual focus on economic reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline, and a strong monetary policy directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In the context of the global commodity slowdown, it helps that India is not an export-dependent nation. These factors underline the World Banks positive projection that Indias gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 7.5 percent in 2016 and 7.7 percent in 2017. Professional Service_CB icons_2015 Working Towards an Optimal Policy Mix Attaining an optimal policy mix entails maintaining a balance between monetary and fiscal policies to ensure long-term sustainable growth. Fiscal Policy: The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the governments spending and taxation plan to steer aggregate demand in the desired direction. Outlined in the annual budget, it impacts income distribution, savings, and investments. When government expenditure exceeds revenue, a fiscal deficit arises. India aims for this to be 3.5 percent in its 2016-2017 budget. Deficit spending is currently accommodating the wage hike recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission to stimulate consumption and business growth. Monetary Policy: The RBI, the countrys central bank, conducts monetary policy. The RBI also influences specific inflation rates and interest rates by changing the money supply in the economy. A low interest rate encourages borrowing, thus spurring consumption. Yet, if the rates are depressed for too long, inflation arises due to excessive demand. Other strategies include buying or selling government securities from or to the public and banks, and altering the liquidity in markets by changing the types of assets/reserves held by the RBI and/or other banks. The RBI Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has exerted caution over lending and banking rates, irrespective of the high growth forecasts. His aim is to achieve an inflation target of five percent by 2016-2017. Most of the RBIs principal interest rates have been kept unchanged, including the base bank rate, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the reverse repo rate, and the marginal standing facility rate. However, the repo rate (rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks) was cut by 25 basis points on April 5 from 6.75 percent to 6.5 percent. Rate cut benefits, if transferred to consumers, boosts borrowing. The RBI also increased the Credit Reserve Ratio (CRR) allowing banks to hold more money. Targeting Non-Performing Assets and Changes in Capital Requirements The RBI has created a central repository, allowing it to see the balance sheets of banks. Large corporate defaulters have currently pushed Indias public banks into a tight corner. Recently, the RBI became aware that stressed assets were not being labeled as Non-Performing-Assets (NPAs). This is because assets declared as NPAs need to be backed up by more capital (as collateral), pressurizing banks to lend less. In India, the bulk of stressed assets are due to government interference, loan waivers, and difficulties in recovering dues. The RBI has responded to the crisis by boosting the ability of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to facilitate the cleanup of public sector debt. ARCs stimulate the economy by resolving bad loans. They buy distressed assets from banks, card companies, and other financial institutions, and re-package them to sell in the market. Banks can sell NPAs to ARCs at a discounted price to clean up their balance sheets. ARCs can also float bonds in order to directly recover dues from borrowers. To induce an influx of capital, companies like J C Flowers & Co and Apollo Global Management are now allowed to set up ARCs in India without the previously required regulatory approval. Edelweiss ARC, the countrys biggest bad loan buyer, plans on buying US $2.4 billion (Rs 160 billion) worth of bad loans this fiscal year; it will need about US $300 million (Rs 20 billion) in new capital before reselling at a profit. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is another tool that aids public debt consolidation. It is defined as the measure of a banks financial strength expressed by the ratio of its capital (net worth and subordinated debt) to its risk-weighted credit exposure (loans). Most banks in India have a capital adequacy of more than 12 percent. Banks with higher capital adequacies are safer because if their loans go bad, they can rely on their net worth. The increase of the CAR has allowed banks to recognize part of their real-estate assets, foreign currency assets, and deferred tax assets as capital, effectively moving them from their Tier 2 reserves to their more accessible Tier 1 reserves so as to combat capital-hungry NPAs. The recovery of NPAs by ARCs will prevent further stalling of large-scale projects, ease borrowers abilities to pay back debt, and relax the constriction of cash flows of private companies (currently corporate earnings lag behind despite the high GDP growth rate). Increased scrutiny over NPAs will also produce a more transparent, competitive business environment  one more devoid of corruption. Proposed Legislative Reforms The 2016-2017 Union Budget reiterated the governments focus on addressing the structural deficit in Indias economic framework. Apart from the budgets stimulus for infrastructure and agriculture spending, various critical bills are currently stuck in the upper house of parliament. If the bills get passed, they will boost real growth by combatting regulatory pressures and ease doing business in India. Some of the important bills are: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill: The proposed GST seeks to replace the current tax system where a specific good is taxed on production and then again on sale. Currently, State Value Added Tax (VAT), which varies from state to state (like other aspects of compliance) causes unnecessary complexity. The additional Central Service Tax or excise duty paid on inputs results in high costs for service providers and traders. Reduced costs and less inter-state trade time will result from the GST law. Also, businesses registered under the GST would be eligible to take tax credit on the GST paid on goods and services. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill: According to the World Banks Ease of Doing Business report, it takes about 4.3 years to resolve insolvency in India. The bankruptcy bill aims to reduce the resolution time to less than a year. The bill proposes a time bound framework for the debt reorganization of corporate partnership firms and individuals. This prevents loss of asset value by easing the exit of failing entities from the business environment. If passed, it could benefit entrepreneurs as credit will become more freely available, and payment of government dues would be prioritized. Land Acquisition Bill: This is another highly awaited law, which will boost transparency in land dealings, leading to savings in project costs. The land bill is concerned with the acquisition of rural private land by the Union or State for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, or urbanization. It provides for proper compensation (while taking into account price rise), rehabilitation, and resettlement of affected land owners. How India reacts to several current properties of the global economy will shape its progress towards a stronger manufacturing sector, increased entrepreneurship, and employment. Weakening Commodity Prices: Being a net importer of crude oil, India benefits significantly from falling oil prices. To ensure gains in the trade deficit, the government has sought to dampen domestic demand for costly commodities like gold with a high import tax rate, a domestic excise duty, and new schemes like Sovereign Gold Bonds. Rising foreign direct investment (FDI) in response to the governments Make in India drive also helps to narrow the current account deficit. Indias Currency Reaction: Despite suffering from relatively lower exports due to the global slowdown, the RBI is insistent on avoiding currency devaluation. Moving away from the equilibrium-determined currency could compromise the competitiveness of Indian exports. Devaluation makes imports more expensive and Indian producers could get complacent and less innovative, stifling long-term productivity. Slowdown of China: India has been shielded from the Chinese slowdown, relative to other countries, mainly due to its weak export links with the northern neighbor. As a net importer of commodities like metals, India benefits from the Chinese slowdown in manufacturing. The situation can also allow India to become an alternate exporter in some categories, and lower labor costs aid India in this endeavor. However, the global commodity slowdown has negatively impacted Indias own domestic heavy manufacturing sectors, and is a long-term threat. Observations India is precariously positioned. While FDI inflows are crucial to its growth, structural changes are required to attract and retain them. The public perception of India is crucial to foreign investors. Towards this, the government and the RBI are aggressively targeting policy reforms to reduce inefficiencies, increase transparency and accountability, and ease doing business in the country. Responsible fiscal and monetary policies aid Indias plans to achieve its projected high growth rate, and are fundamental in combatting the current slowdown in the global economic recovery."
11,"The Union Government has till date given in-principle approval for disinvestment of 33 Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). These 33 CPSEs include subsidiaries, units and even Joint Ventures. Under this strategic disinvestment, the Central Government will be selling its majority stake and will transfer the management control to the investor. These 33 CPSEs are not only profit-making but loss-making ones as well. Government considers the of strategic disinvestment of those CPSEs which are not in the priority sectors. The Central Government has mandated the NITI Aayog to identify the CPSEs that require disinvestment. The NITI Aayog identifies such CPSEs based on the certain criteria laid down by the Central Government itself. The detailed criteria along with the complete list of CPSEs are mentioned below."
12,"Saudi Aramco is set to acquire 20 percent stake in RIL oil refinery and chemical business at a value of $75 billion or over 5.3 lakh crore. The announcement was made by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani during the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries on August 12. The RIL Saudi Aramco deal would be one of Indias largest foreign direct investment deals to date. Under the deal, Saudi Aramco will buy 20 percent stake in a proposed special purpose vehicle (SPV) housing RILs twin refineries as well as its petrochemical complex. Saudi Aramco has also agreed to supply 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude oil to RILs twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat on a long-term basis. RIL operates two refineries in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which have a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. The Jamnagar Refinery is one of the worlds largest oil refining facility. It can process 1.4 million barrels per day (BPD) and plans to expand its capacity to 2 million BPD by 2030."
14,"When Twitter Inc.s top executives walked out of its San Francisco headquarters Thursday, they may as well have been carrying bags of Elon Musks cash. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde, Twitters head of legal policy, received a golden parachute clause in Twitters TWTR merger with Musks X Holdings. Musk reportedly fired all three Thursday evening upon officially taking control of the social network in a $44 billion acquisition, and will be obligated to give more than $204 million of it to those three, according to Twitters filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Agrawal, Segal and Gadde own roughly 1.2 million shares of Twitter, more than half of that a $34.8 million stake owned by Gadde. The trios roughly $65 million stake would be purchased by Musk like any other shareholders stock. Additionally, a clause in the merger agreement provided accelerated vesting of promised future stock compensation  and thats where the biggest chunk of money comes in. The Golden Parachute Compensation clause in Twitters SEC filing  which was the deal approved by Twitter shareholders  shows the trio would automatically vest stock worth $119.6 million as severance if terminated, with the largest payout there going to Agrawal at $56 million. Theyre also entitled to a years salary and health benefits. In 2021, Agrawal had a base pay of $623,000, while Segal and Gaddes base pay was $600,000 each. In total, Gadde is set to walk away from Twitter with the biggest haul: Nearly $74 million. Agrawal and Segal arent far behind her, though, at roughly $65 million and $66 million, respectively. Twitter shares have rallied 26% over the past month and closed Thursday at $53.70, close to the $54.20 share price Musk, whos also CEO of Tesla Inc.

TSLA, +1.52% and SpaceX and a frequent Twitter user, offered to buy Twitter in April. After reaching an agreement with Twitters board to buy the social media company for $44 billion, Musk tried to back out of the deal and Twitter sued him. He faced a Friday deadline to complete the deal or face trial. In a tweet late Thursday night, Musk said only: the bird is freed. Thursday morning, Musk signaled a deal was imminent when he tweeted a statement aimed at assuring advertisers, some of whom might be concerned about his plans for content moderation. Musk has said one of his motivations for buying the platform is related to complaints about censorship, mostly from people who have been banned because they have violated Twitters terms of service. Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! Musk said in his statement to advertisers Thursday. Twitter did not immediately return a request for comment late Thursday. The Bloomberg report added that Musk also plans to end lifetime bans for users, meaning former President Donald Trump could return to Twitter, though its unclear how soon that could happen, the source said. Twitter shares have rallied 26% over the past month, closing Thursday at $53.70, close to the $54.20 share price Musk agreed to pay in April."

In total, Gadde is set to walk away from Twitter with the biggest haul: Nearly $74 million. Agrawal and Segal arent far behind her, though, at roughly $65 million and $66 million, respectively. Twitter shares have rallied 26% over the past month and closed Thursday at $53.70, close to the $54.20 share price Musk, whos also CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.52% and the worlds wealthiest individual, agreed to pay in April. The acquisition ends months of legal wrangling after Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.52% and SpaceX and a frequent Twitter user, offered to buy Twitter in April. After reaching an agreement with Twitters board to buy the social media company for $44 billion, Musk tried to back out of the deal and Twitter sued him. He faced a Friday deadline to complete the deal or face trial. In a tweet late Thursday night, Musk said only: the bird is freed. Thursday morning, Musk signaled a deal was imminent when he tweeted a statement aimed at assuring advertisers, some of whom might be concerned about his plans for content moderation. Musk has said one of his motivations for buying the platform is related to complaints about censorship, mostly from people who have been banned because they have violated Twitters terms of service. Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! Musk said in his statement to advertisers Thursday. Twitter did not immediately return a request for comment late Thursday. The Bloomberg report added that Musk also plans to end lifetime bans for users, meaning former President Donald Trump could return to Twitter, though its unclear how soon that could happen, the source said. Twitter shares have rallied 26% over the past month, closing Thursday at $53.70, close to the $54.20 share price Musk agreed to pay in April."
18,"Amidst the declining optimism towards emerging economies, Indias economic outlook remains positive. This is due to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led governments dual focus on economic reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline, and a strong monetary policy directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In the context of the global commodity slowdown, it helps that India is not an export-dependent nation. These factors underline the World Banks positive projection that Indias gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 7.5 percent in 2016 and 7.7 percent in 2017. Professional Service_CB icons_2015 Working Towards an Optimal Policy Mix Attaining an optimal policy mix entails maintaining a balance between monetary and fiscal policies to ensure long-term sustainable growth. Fiscal Policy: The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the governments spending and taxation plan to steer aggregate demand in the desired direction. Outlined in the annual budget, it impacts income distribution, savings, and investments. When government expenditure exceeds revenue, a fiscal deficit arises. India aims for this to be 3.5 percent in its 2016-2017 budget. Deficit spending is currently accommodating the wage hike recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission to stimulate consumption and business growth. Monetary Policy: The RBI, the countrys central bank, conducts monetary policy. The RBI also influences specific inflation rates and interest rates by changing the money supply in the economy. A low interest rate encourages borrowing, thus spurring consumption. Yet, if the rates are depressed for too long, inflation arises due to excessive demand. Other strategies include buying or selling government securities from or to the public and banks, and altering the liquidity in markets by changing the types of assets/reserves held by the RBI and/or other banks. The RBI Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has exerted caution over lending and banking rates, irrespective of the high growth forecasts. His aim is to achieve an inflation target of five percent by 2016-2017. Most of the RBIs principal interest rates have been kept unchanged, including the base bank rate, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the reverse repo rate, and the marginal standing facility rate. However, the repo rate (rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks) was cut by 25 basis points on April 5 from 6.75 percent to 6.5 percent. Rate cut benefits, if transferred to consumers, boosts borrowing. The RBI also increased the Credit Reserve Ratio (CRR) allowing banks to hold more money. Targeting Non-Performing Assets and Changes in Capital Requirements The RBI has created a central repository, allowing it to see the balance sheets of banks. Large corporate defaulters have currently pushed Indias public banks into a tight corner. Recently, the RBI became aware that stressed assets were not being labeled as Non-Performing-Assets (NPAs). This is because assets declared as NPAs need to be backed up by more capital (as collateral), pressurizing banks to lend less. In India, the bulk of stressed assets are due to government interference, loan waivers, and difficulties in recovering dues. The RBI has responded to the crisis by boosting the ability of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to facilitate the cleanup of public sector debt. ARCs stimulate the economy by resolving bad loans. They buy distressed assets from banks, card companies, and other financial institutions, and re-package them to sell in the market. Banks can sell NPAs to ARCs at a discounted price to clean up their balance sheets. ARCs can also float bonds in order to directly recover dues from borrowers. To induce an influx of capital, companies like J C Flowers & Co and Apollo Global Management are now allowed to set up ARCs in India without the previously required regulatory approval. Edelweiss ARC, the countrys biggest bad loan buyer, plans on buying US $2.4 billion (Rs 160 billion) worth of bad loans this fiscal year; it will need about US $300 million (Rs 20 billion) in new capital before reselling at a profit. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is another tool that aids public debt consolidation. It is defined as the measure of a banks financial strength expressed by the ratio of its capital (net worth and subordinated debt) to its risk-weighted credit exposure (loans). Most banks in India have a capital adequacy of more than 12 percent. Banks with higher capital adequacies are safer because if their loans go bad, they can rely on their net worth. The increase of the CAR has allowed banks to recognize part of their real-estate assets, foreign currency assets, and deferred tax assets as capital, effectively moving them from their Tier 2 reserves to their more accessible Tier 1 reserves so as to combat capital-hungry NPAs. The recovery of NPAs by ARCs will prevent further stalling of large-scale projects, ease borrowers abilities to pay back debt, and relax the constriction of cash flows of private companies (currently corporate earnings lag behind despite the high GDP growth rate). Increased scrutiny over NPAs will also produce a more transparent, competitive business environment  one more devoid of corruption. Proposed Legislative Reforms The 2016-2017 Union Budget reiterated the governments focus on addressing the structural deficit in Indias economic framework. Apart from the budgets stimulus for infrastructure and agriculture spending, various critical bills are currently stuck in the upper house of parliament. If the bills get passed, they will boost real growth by combatting regulatory pressures and ease doing business in India. Some of the important bills are: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill: The proposed GST seeks to replace the current tax system where a specific good is taxed on production and then again on sale. Currently, State Value Added Tax (VAT), which varies from state to state (like other aspects of compliance) causes unnecessary complexity. The additional Central Service Tax or excise duty paid on inputs results in high costs for service providers and traders. Reduced costs and less inter-state trade time will result from the GST law. Also, businesses registered under the GST would be eligible to take tax credit on the GST paid on goods and services. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill: According to the World Banks Ease of Doing Business report, it takes about 4.3 years to resolve insolvency in India. The bankruptcy bill aims to reduce the resolution time to less than a year. The bill proposes a time bound framework for the debt reorganization of corporate partnership firms and individuals. This prevents loss of asset value by easing the exit of failing entities from the business environment. If passed, it could benefit entrepreneurs as credit will become more freely available, and payment of government dues would be prioritized. Land Acquisition Bill: This is another highly awaited law, which will boost transparency in land dealings, leading to savings in project costs. The land bill is concerned with the acquisition of rural private land by the Union or State for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, or urbanization. It provides for proper compensation (while taking into account price rise), rehabilitation, and resettlement of affected land owners. How India reacts to several current properties of the global economy will shape its progress towards a stronger manufacturing sector, increased entrepreneurship, and employment. Weakening Commodity Prices: Being a net importer of crude oil, India benefits significantly from falling oil prices. To ensure gains in the trade deficit, the government has sought to dampen domestic demand for costly commodities like gold with a high import tax rate, a domestic excise duty, and new schemes like Sovereign Gold Bonds. Rising foreign direct investment (FDI) in response to the governments Make in India drive also helps to narrow the current account deficit. Indias Currency Reaction: Despite suffering from relatively lower exports due to the global slowdown, the RBI is insistent on avoiding currency devaluation. Moving away from the equilibrium-determined currency could compromise the competitiveness of Indian exports. Devaluation makes imports more expensive and Indian producers could get complacent and less innovative, stifling long-term productivity. Slowdown of China: India has been shielded from the Chinese slowdown, relative to other countries, mainly due to its weak export links with the northern neighbor. As a net importer of commodities like metals, India benefits from the Chinese slowdown in manufacturing. The situation can also allow India to become an alternate exporter in some categories, and lower labor costs aid India in this endeavor. However, the global commodity slowdown has negatively impacted Indias own domestic heavy manufacturing sectors, and is a long-term threat. Observations India is precariously positioned. While FDI inflows are crucial to its growth, structural changes are required to attract and retain them. The public perception of India is crucial to foreign investors. Towards this, the government and the RBI are aggressively targeting policy reforms to reduce inefficiencies, increase transparency and accountability, and ease doing business in the country. Responsible fiscal and monetary policies aid Indias plans to achieve its projected high growth rate, and are fundamental in combatting the current slowdown in the global economic recovery."
19,"The U.S. economy posted its first period of positive growth for 2022 in the third quarter, at least temporarily easing recession fears, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday. GDP, a sum of all the goods and services produced from July through September, increased at a 2.6% annualized pace for the period, according to the advance estimate. That was above against the Dow Jones forecast for 2.3%. That reading follows consecutive negative quarters to start the year, meeting a commonly accepted definition of recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research is generally considered the arbiter of downturns and expansions. The growth came in large part due to a narrowing trade deficit, which economists expected and consider to be a one-off occurrence that wont be repeated in future quarters. GDP gains also came from increases in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment and government spending. The report reflected an ongoing shift to services spending over goods, with spending on the former increasing 2.8% while goods spending dropped 1.2%. Declines in residential fixed investment and private inventories offset the gains, the BEA said. Overall, while the 2.6% rebound in the third quarter more than reversed the decline in the first half of the year, we dont expect this strength to be sustained, wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. Exports will soon fade and domestic demand is getting crushed under the weight of higher interest rates. We expect the economy to enter a mild recession in the first half of next year. Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data watch now VIDEO04:28 Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data Markets were higher following the release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 300 points in early trading on Wall Street. In other economic news Thursday, weekly jobless claims edged higher to 217,000 but were still below the 220,000 estimate. Also, orders for long-lasting goods increased 0.4% in September from the previous month, below the 0.7% expectation. The report comes as policymakers fight a pitched battle against inflation, which is running around its highest levels in more than 40 years. Price surges have come due a number of factors, many related to the Covid pandemic but also pushed by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus that is still working its way through the financial system. The underlying picture from the BEA report showed an economy slowing in key areas, particularly the consumer and private investment. Consumer spending as measured through personal consumption expenditures increased at just a 1.4% pace in the quarter, down from 2% in Q2. Gross private domestic investment fell 8.5%, continuing a trend after falling 14.1% in the second quarter. Residential investment, a gauge of homebuilding, tumbled 26.4% after falling 17.8% in Q2, reflecting a sharp slowdown in the real estate market. On the plus side, exports, which add to GDP, rose 14.4% while imports, which subtract, dropped 6.9%. Net exports of goods and services added 2.77 percentage points to the headline total, meaning GDP essentially would have been flat otherwise. There was some good news on the inflation front. The chain-weighted price index, a cost-of-living measure that adjusts for consumer behavior, rose 4.1% for the quarter, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 5.3% gain, due in large part to falling energy prices. Also, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 4.2%, down sharply from 7.3% in the prior quarter. Core prices, excluding food and energy, increased 4.5%, about in line with Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, the Fed began a campaign of interest rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Since March, the central bank has raised its benchmark borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, taking it to its highest level since just before the worst of the financial crisis. Those increases are aimed at slowing the flow of money through the economy and taming a jobs market where openings outnumber available workers by nearly 2 to 1, a situation that has driven up wages and contributed to a wage-price spiral that economists fear will tip the U.S. into recession. Our concerns about going into recession would not necessarily be from any of this data. It comes more from how much the Fed cranks up rates and what happens when firms and consumers respond to this, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. The most encouraging thing is you still have consumer spending, you still have job growth and wage growth and that should help on the consumer spending side, he added. What we would be most concerned about would be a sharp pullback by businesses in their hiring. The Fed is widely accepted to approve a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike at its meeting next week, but then might slow the pace of increases afterward as officials take time to assess the impact of policy on economic conditions. The Fed will continue to err on the side of overtightening, which is reasonable given the desire to mitigate the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at high levels, said Preston Caldwell, head of U.S. economics for Morningstar. After December, were likely to see the pace of tightening slow quite dramatically. Policymakers will get another, more current look at inflation data when the BEA releases a report Friday that will include personal consumption expenditures prices for September. That measure is expected to show that core prices excluding food and energy rose 5.2% from a year ago and 0.5% on a monthly basis."

22,"Indias economy grew at a record pace in the second quarter, even as the country grappled with a devastating wave of Covid-19. But Asias third largest economy isnt out of the woods yet and remains smaller than at the start of the pandemic. GDP rose 20.1% in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year earlier. The big jump reflects a rebound from the deep slump in activity in 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed one of the worlds toughest lockdowns on 1.3 billion people, restricting business and travel for months and plunging the country into its first recession in decades. The record year-on-year rise in Indian GDP in Q2 was due entirely to base effects, wrote Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics in a research note. This time last year, India posted a 24% fall in GDP. India had just begun to claw its way out of the slump earlier this year when a second wave of the coronavirus  believed by experts to have been sparked by the now-global Delta variant  engulfed the country. For weeks, India reported thousands of Covid-related deaths every day. Even as the infection rate spiraled, Modi resisted pressure to impose another national lockdown, a strategy intended to prevent millions of people from slipping back into poverty. That meant that even though the human cost of this springs outbreak was staggering, economic activity rebounded rapidly once cases started declining. Still, the second wave took its toll on the economy. India does not provide official quarter-on-quarter GDP data, but Capital Economics estimates that the economy shrank by 12% in the April-June period compared with the preceding three months. [This] contraction is very large by historic standards, and sharper than we had been anticipating, Shah added. Anagha Deodhar, chief economist at ICICI Securities, said Tuesdays annual growth figure was weaker than she was expecting. If you look at pre-pandemic levels, we are still a smaller economy by 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion), Deodhar told CNN Business, adding that manufacturing, agriculture and exports have done well for the country recently. Exports are driving growth mainly because global economy is recovering faster than the domestic one. Business activity has inched above pre-pandemic levels for the past three weeks, according to a Business Resumption Index compiled by Nomura, which tracks mobility indices, power demand and the labor force participation rate, among other metrics. There are other positive signs as well: Indias vaccination rate has picked up, with the country on track to fully vaccinate about half of the population by the end of the year, Nomura analysts said. But the economic recovery still faces threats over the next few months, as cases begin to rise again in the Southern Indian state of Kerala. The Nomura analysts said a potential third wave cannot be ruled out, especially with the festive Diwali season approaching."

24,"Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk thinks the global economic decline could last for another year and a half. In a Twitter exchange early Friday morning Eastern time, the mercurial electric car executive and worlds richest man said a recession could continue until spring of 24. The remarks came in response to a tweet from Shibetoshi Nakamoto, the online name for Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who noted that current coronavirus numbers are actually pretty low. i [sic] guess all we have to worry about now is the impending global recession and nuclear apocalypse. It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event, Musk replied. Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a Twitter account with nearly 600,000 followers, then asked Musk how long he thought the recession would last, to which he replied, Just guessing, but probably until spring of 24. Global GDP grew 6% in 2021 but is expected to decelerate to 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. That would mark the weakest pace of growth since 2001 outside of the financial crisis in 2008 and the brief plunge in the early days of the Covid pandemic. The Federal Reserve projects GDP in the U.S. to grow just 0.2% this year and 1.2% in 2023. Musk becomes the latest corporate titan to express reservations about the economy. In a tweet Wednesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said its time to batten down the hatches in preparation for rough economic waters ahead. That tweet accompanied a video of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who said in a CNBC interview that he thinks theres a good chance of a recession in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also has been warning of economic turmoil ahead. Musks comment also came amid a rough week for Tesla stock as the automaker missed revenue estimates and cautioned about a potential delivery shortfall this year. During the analyst call, Musk expressed more confidence in the U.S. economy than other parts of the world. He also noted the impact that interest rate increases are having on the economy. The U.S. actually is in  North Americas in pretty good health, he said. A little bit of that is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think theyll eventually realize that and bring back down, I think. However, he said China is in quite a burst of a recession of sorts driven by the real estate market, while Europe has a recession of sorts, driven by energy."""

""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India... We maintain a negative outlook on India's BBB- sovereign credit ratings,"" S&P Senior Director Sovereign and International Public Finance Ratings (Asia-Pacific) Kim Eng Tan said in an emailed statement. 'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade and a downgrade would mean pushing the country's sovereign rating to junk status, making overseas borrowings by corporates costlier. Referring to the recent measures announced by the government to restrict capital outflow, Tan said these ""have also increased uncertainties among investors both foreign and domestic"". ""If the uncertainty continues, business financing conditions could deteriorate further and investment growth could slow further"". In order to tame the sliding Rupee, the Reserve Bank and the government had on August 14 announced stern measures, including curbs on Indian firms investing abroad and on outward remittances by resident Indians. S&P's comments come on a day when the rupee touched the record low of 64.11 to a dollar in intra-day trade today. Moody's Investor's Service in its report today said the depreciating rupee is likely to inflate the fuel subsidy bill, weaken the credit quality of oil companies and put pressure on the fiscal deficit. Earlier in May S&P had warned that it may downgrade India's sovereign rating to junk grade if the government fails to pursue reforms and check deterioration in fiscal and current account deficits. S&P said its future credit rating action would depend upon the response of policymakers to the latest economic developments. India's long term growth prospects could weaken on a sustained basis, with negative implications for the sovereign credit fundamentals, it said. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India. We believe this to be a result of the declining economic growth in the past two years and what some investors view as insufficient long-term policy response that could reverse the decline and revive investments,"" S&P said. It added that investments continue to be stifled by inadequate infrastructure, rigidities in labour and product markets, and red tape, among other issues. A sliding rupee, which is mainly on account of widening Current Account Deficit (CAD), will make imports costlier and fuel subsidy bill. The CAD, which is the difference between the inflow and outflow of foreign currency, had touched a record high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 fiscal. Finance Minister P Chidambaram last week said that CAD will be contained at USD 70 billion or 3.7 per cent in the current fiscal and it is a red line which will not be breached. Moody's has said despite previous price liberalisation in the petroleum sector, the subsidy bill is likely to rise due to depreciation, thus widening the government's deficit, which is also under pressure from slower revenue growth. ""We believe the currency will remain under pressure until the current account deficit narrows meaningfully, or capital inflows accelerate due to an improving growth outlook,"" Moody's said."

The announcement was made by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani during the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries on August 12. The RIL Saudi Aramco deal would be one of Indias largest foreign direct investment deals to date. Under the deal, Saudi Aramco will buy 20 percent stake in a proposed special purpose vehicle (SPV) housing RILs twin refineries as well as its petrochemical complex. Saudi Aramco has also agreed to supply 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude oil to RILs twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat on a long-term basis. RIL operates two refineries in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which have a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. The Jamnagar Refinery is one of the worlds largest oil refining facility. It can process 1.4 million barrels per day (BPD) and plans to expand its capacity to 2 million BPD by 2030."
28,"India's foreign exchange (forex) reserves declined $3.8 billion to $524.5 billion for the week ending October 21, data released by Reserve Bank of India on Friday showed. Reserves are at their lowest levels since July 2020. Since last year, reserves have declined by $115 billion. The primary reason for the decline is foreign currency assets, which recorded a dip of $3.5 billion to $465 billion. Value of gold held by the central bank declined $2.47 billion compared to October 14. Gold accounts for 7.1 per cent of India's total forex reserves. The RBI has been selling rupees to prevent a rapid depreciation. On October 21, the rupee depreciated 6 paise to a record low of 83.06 against the US dollar in opening trade due to a stronger greenback overseas and unrelenting foreign fund outflows. On October 27, the rupee and government bonds strengthened as weak economic data in the US sparked speculation of the Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its rate increases. The domestic currency settled at 82.50 per dollar as against 82.73 per dollar on Tuesday. So far in 2022, the Fed has raised interest rates by 300 bps in order to bring down US inflation, which has hovered around 40-year highs for many months. The US rate hikes have led to sweeping strength in the dollar, higher US bond yields and consequently reduced the appeal of assets in emerging markets such as India."
30,"India is expected to surpass its tax collection goal by more than 2 trillion rupees ($24.3 billion) in the current fiscal year, according to two officials with knowledge on the matter. Strong revenue receipts is giving Prime Minister Narendra Modis government leeway to contain the budget deficit within 6.4% of gross domestic product amid a ballooning subsidy bill, said the two officials. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Steady collections and measures to reduce tax evasion are helping bolster revenue against a target of 19.34 trillion rupees, they said. The government will likely collect this financial year an additional 300 billion-400 billion rupees from windfall tax imposed on export of some fuels and local production of crude oil from July, the officials said. The states increasing income puts it on track to further narrow the budget deficit in the year ending March 2023 from a record 9.2% of GDP during the first year of the pandemic while sustaining Modis free food program, fertilizer subsidies and other inflation-busting measures. Indias improving tax collections will also help counter sluggish state asset sales, the officials said. The government has only sold about a third of the 650 billion rupees worth of assets targeted for divestment. Indias union budget, due to be presented in February, will outline the federal spending plan for the coming fiscal year. Its always a closely-watched event, and especially amid the challenges facing Asias third-largest economy including slowing growth and elevated inflation."

32,"The Commerce Department analysis found U.S. gross domestic product, a broad economic measure that tallies the value of finished goods and services produced across the nation, saw nominal growth over the last three months following declines in the first two quarters of the year. According to the report, the increase in real GDP reflects increases in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and private inventory investment. Does GDP growth mean a recession is off the table? Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, like what occurred in the U.S. in the first half of this year, is one of the bellwethers of the start of an economic recession. While a mixed set of factors helped drive overall economic growth in July-September, economists say the positive uptick is by no means a sign that recession worries are off the table. Consumer spending is down slightly, but it has remained surprisingly vibrant throughout the year and has helped bolster the economy, even as prices on goods and services have soared and the price of debt, like interest rates on carryover credit card balances and mortgage rates, have hit the highest levels in decades. A still robust U.S. jobs market has also functioned as a balancing factor against other, negative economic indicators Per a new report from The Associated Press, the outlook for the overall economy remains gloomy. The Fed has raised interest rates five times this year and is set to do so again next week and in December. Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that the Feds hikes will bring pain in the form of higher unemployment and possibly a recession. Looking ahead, risks are to the downside, to consumption in particular, as households continue to face challenges from high prices and likely slower job growth going forward, Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. Despite the swing in the headline GDP, conditions on the ground for consumers havent changed much, and concerns for an economic downturn remain, per CNN. I do think theres roughly a 50-50 probability of recession in 2023, Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. We are starting to see job growth slow; housing is becoming more of a drag; consumer spending growth, although thats holding up, is also slowing; and theres a potential that as interest rates move even higher through the rest of this year, that we could see a recession some time next year. The new Commerce Department report notes a price index in the GDP data rose at a 4.1% annual rate from July through September, down from 9% in the April-June period  less than economists had expected and the smallest increase since the final three months of 2020, according to The Associated Press. The latest inflation report from the U.S. Labor Department, released earlier this month, found the consumer price index rose 0.4% in September and was up 8.2% from a year ago. Mountain West states, including Utah, continued to see the highest regional inflation in the country in September, coming in at 9.6% up year over year. Cost increases in shelter, food and medical care were the largest contributors to the monthly uptick, according to the Department of Labor. While those costs were partly offset by a 4.9% decline in gas prices, food prices are continuing to rise up 0.8% from the month before. Energy prices fell 2.1% over the month along with gas prices, but natural gas and electricity costs increased. Year over year, energy prices increased 19.8% and food was up 11.2%."
33,"Technology stocks led a broad rally on Wall Street Friday, capping another strong week for the market, as investors welcomed solid profits from Apple and other companies. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% and posted its first back-to-back weekly gains since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9%. Smaller company stocks also gained ground, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 2.3%. Apple's latest quarterly results showed the iPhone maker made even fatter profits during the summer than expected. Its shares rose 7.6% and led a rally in technology stocks that had largely been beat up a day earlier. Intel jumped 10.7% after delivering much bigger profit than analysts forecasted even though it said it saw worsening economic conditions. Gilead Sciences soared 12.9%, and T-Mobile US gained 7.4% after they also topped Wall Street's profit expectations. Investors were also encouraged by a report on consumer spending that came a day after new data showing the economy grew modestly in the third quarter and inflation eased. ""You have an economy that almost refuses to keel over, an economy that at its core is resilient, but a the same time inflation is easing and that is what the Fed wants and that's obviously what the market wants, said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. That's helped fuel hopes on Wall Street for a pivot by the Federal Reserve, where the central bank dials down the big interest-rate hikes that have shaken the market. Such a move could boost the market, though many analysts say such hopes may be overdone. The central bank has been very clear about its plan to err on the side of going too far in order to tame inflation, which means the big gains on hopes of a pullback seem premature, said Liz Young, chief investment strategist at SoFi. This rally has now gotten a bit irrational and fragile at this level, Young said. The S&P 500 rose 93.76 points to 3,901.06. The Dow gained 828.52 points to 32,861.80. The Nasdaq rose 309.78 points to 11,102.45. The Russell 2000 gained 40.60 points to 1,846.92. Many big U.S. companies have been reporting stronger earnings than expected, though the bag remains decidedly mixed. Solid earnings on Friday helped to offset a 6.8% drop for Amazon, which offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for upcoming revenue. It was the latest Big Tech company to take a beating this week after reporting some discouraging trends. It's a sharp turnaround after the group dominated Wall Street for years with seemingly unstoppable growth. Earlier in the week, Meta Platforms lost nearly a quarter of its value after reporting a second straight quarter of revenue decline amid falling advertising sales and stiff competition from TikTok. Microsoft and Google's parent company also reported slowdowns in key areas. Such woes have created a sharp split on Wall Street this week, between lagging Big Tech stocks and the rest of the market. The Nasdaq, which is stuffed with high-growth tech stocks, notched a 2.2% gain this week. It would have had an even worse showing if not for Apple's boost from Friday. The Dow, meanwhile, jumped 5.7% for the week because it has less of an emphasis on tech. Rising interest rates have hit Big Tech stock prices harder than the rest of the market, and the pressure increased Friday as yields climbed. The markets still seem to not want to believe that we might end up in a place where an earnings recession is possible, Young said. Data released in the morning showed the raises that U.S. workers got in wages and other compensation during the summer was in line with economists expectations. That should keep the Fed on track to keep hiking rates sharply in hopes of weakening the job market enough to undercut the nations high inflation. Other data showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation remains very high, and U.S. households continue to spend more in the face of it. The Fed is trying to starve inflation of the purchases made by households and businesses needed to keep it high. It's doing that by intentionally slowing the economy and the jobs market. The worry is that it could go too far and cause a sharp downturn. The Fed has already raised its benchmark overnight interest rate up to a range of 3% to 3.25% up from virtually zero in March. The widespread expectation is for it to push through another increase that's triple the usual size next week, before it potentially makes a smaller increase in December. Higher rates not only slow the economy, they also hurt prices for stocks and other investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.42% from 4.28% late Thursday. The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and many other loans, climbed to 4.01% from 3.93%. Trading in Twitter's stock has ended, after Elon Musk took control of the company following a lengthy legal battle."
36,"Pending home sales fell for the fourth straight month in September, as mortgage rates topped 7% and the cost of buying a house soared, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. The groups pending home sales index tumbled 10.2% from August, leaving sales 31% below where they were a year ago. The number was worse than expected. ""Persistent inflation has proven quite harmful to the housing market,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. ""The Federal Reserve has had to drastically raise interest rates to quell inflation, which has resulted in far fewer buyers and even fewer sellers."" It is further evidence, along with a slowdown in new residential construction, that the heady days of the housing sector seen in 2021 and early 2022 are over. For buyers of a median-priced home who use a 20% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment has shot up a shocking $1,000 higher than last year, George Ratiu, senior economist and manager of economic research at Realtor.com said. With wages falling behind on account of inflation, and rates rising, buyers purchasing power has been reduced by over $100,000. There is also an effect on existing homeowners, who may be looking to sell as prices come off their highs of earlier this year. The number of new listings on the market is also down considerably, as existing homeowners sit tight with sub-3% mortgage rates, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. The combination of sagging demand and limited inventory means that home sales activity will continue to drop off during the last quarter of the year. Overall, total home sales for 2022 will be down significantly from last year, likely hitting a level not seen since 2014. The rise in rates and drop in sales activity is a direct result of the Federal Reserves tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. The Fed is seeking to cool down the economy even if that results in higher unemployment and even a recession. The economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the third quarter, reversing direction after two previous quarters showed a contraction in the nations gross domestic output. Earlier Thursday, the governments personal consumption expenditures price index showed that spending increased 0.6% in September as Americans dipped into their savings and credit cards to continue consuming even as inflation held steady during the month. ""Todays report showed some positive signs: the topline PCE inflation number slowed, and incomes and consumer spending came in slightly above expectations, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at data analytics firm Morning Consult. However, there are still reasons to worry. Core PCE inflation continued to rise, confirming consumers are still contending with elevated prices. Morning Consults proprietary monthly inflation data from mid-October hints that inflation may be slowing, but consumer spending will likely remain under pressure until meaningful price relief kicks in, Bruun added. Also Friday, the University of Michigans consumer sentiment survey for October remained largely unchanged and reflected a mixed bag of improving supply chain issues and worries over inflation and uncertainty over the economys future course. This month, buying conditions for durables surged 23% on the basis of easing prices and supply constraints, said Joanne Hsu, survey director. However, year-ahead expected business conditions worsened 19%. These divergent patterns reflect substantial uncertainty over inflation, policy responses, and developments worldwide, and consumer views are consistent with a recession ahead in the economy."

38,"Housing is most Americans' biggest expense. Due to inflation, pandemic-related supply and demand shocks and increased lifestyle flexibility, rents throughout the United States are soaring. These rent increases pose a serious threat to any retirement budget, but theres a simple solution: Swap out life in the most popular U.S. retirement havens for overseas equivalents. Many retirement spots overseas offer comparable lifestyles to the U.S. at significantly lower costs. Here's a look at rental costs in U.S. retirement destinations versus similar locations overseas. Tampa, Florida, vs. Corozal, Belize Florida is a popular state for retirement, and Tampa draws many retirees. Over a quarter of the population is 60 or older. Retirees love Tampa for its year-round warm weather and combination of laid-back beach atmosphere with big-city amenities. But housing costs in Tampa are no longer affordable for many retirees. The median monthly rent is $1,160, but it can be much higher in some areas. Just over a two-hour flight from Florida is Corozal, Belize, where a couple can live comfortably on a monthly budget of far less. Rent is especially affordable in Corozal, costing between $300 and $500 per month for a two-bedroom, local-style home with sea views. Corozal is found in northern Belize, tucked away in an inlet of the Caribbean Sea. Expats are drawn here for the warm weather, aquamarine ocean waters and simple, back-to-basics lifestyle. But Corozal is a sleepy town. While it offers much of the same laid-back appeal as Tampa, its infrastructure is lacking. Luckily, Corozal is only nine miles from Chetumal, just across the Mexican border, where retirees can shop for U.S. products at big-box retailers and access additional health care options. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, vs. Rota, Spain South Carolina attracts many retirees, and Myrtle Beach, with its coastal living opportunities and excellent golf courses, has a lot of appeal. Over a third of the Myrtle Beach population is age 60 or older. Property prices in Myrtle Beach are lower than in some other parts of the U.S., but they are growing. The median monthly rent is $976, and it costs a median of $1,296 per month to own a home with a mortgage. A lifestyle similar to what Myrtle Beach offers can be enjoyed for even less overseas. By relocating to Rota, Spain, you can instantly free up savings in your retirement budget on rent alone. The average rent for a two-bedroom place in Rota is about $600 to $750 per month. Located on Spains southern Atlantic Coast, Rota also has seaside appeal, with long expanses of pristine, soft-sand beaches. Its one of the warmest, sunniest areas of mainland Europe, and its an under-the-radar golf destination, where membership fees are a fraction of Myrtle Beach prices. Plus, the U.S. dollar is at a 20-year high against the euro, making Europe more affordable for Americans right now. Rota is home to a naval base thats shared by Spanish and U.S. forces, with many U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force personnel living in the area. If youre looking for a lower cost of living in Europe with an American-influenced community, Rota is a top option. Scottsdale, Arizona, vs. Chitré, Panama Arizona's pleasant winter weather is a big draw for many retirees. In the Phoenix metro area, 21% of the population is age 60 or older, and the median rent is $1,177 monthly. Scottsdale, in particular, draws many retirees, especially during the winter months. Compare that to Chitré, an up-and-coming retirement destination on the northeast coast of Panamas Azuero Peninsula, where a two-bedroom property typically rents for $300 to $450 monthly. While everywhere in Panama is hot year-round, Chitré sits in a desert-like region that gets less rainfall and humidity than other parts of the country, so the climate is similar to Scottsdales. There are several nearby beaches where you can buy beachfront property at shockingly low rates. Chitré is not a household name in the United States, but the area is home to a small group of about 500 North American expats. Theyre drawn by the ease of life in Chitré, low cost of living and safe community. Chitré has above-average amenities and infrastructure for a Panamanian small town. Chicago vs. Medellín, Colombia For those who want a city atmosphere in retirement, Chicago is a top option in the United States. About 21% of the Chicago population is 60 and older. Chicago is centrally located and offers plenty to see and do. Chicago can feel affordable compared to other big U.S. cities, but property prices are rising steadily. The median monthly rent is $1,155. But retirees dont have to settle for these prices to enjoy a cosmopolitan atmosphere. Medellín is Colombias culture capital, and it allows for a Euro-chic lifestyle at a fraction of Chicagos prices. The monthly cost of living is highly customizable, but $2,000 monthly is enough for most couples to live comfortably, including the cost of renting a modern two-bedroom apartment, which is about $700 per month. Medellín boasts world-class museums, galleries, sports teams, performing arts venues, festivals and fine dining. These big-city amenities are likely to feel affordable to Americans, thanks to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Colombian peso. Medellín has an efficient public transport system and pleasant year-round weather, helping you save money on your energy bills. Theres no need to heat or cool your home when the temperature is perpetually between about 65 and 75 degrees. Sacramento, California, vs. Lisbon, Portugal With natural beauty, wine country, great weather and cultural attractions, California is a dream retirement destination for many people. But the cost of living is prohibitively expensive for most retirees in the most populous U.S. state. Sacramento is a relatively affordable choice for retirees compared to other California cities, but even here, life comes at a premium. The median rent for a Sacramento property is $1,364 per month. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean is Portugal, where the lifestyle is similar to California. Portugals capital city can feel like a bargain for U.S. retirees. Lisbon apartments rent for an average of $840 per month. Even though property prices are on the rise, Lisbon is one of Europes most affordable capital cities. The U.S. dollars strength further accentuates the savings opportunities in Europe. Lisbon is one of Europes oldest cities, with historical ambiance and Old World charm. Its found where the River Tagus empties into the Atlantic Ocean, with swimmable beaches just a few minutes from the city. With some of Europes best weather and incomparable cultural amenities, its hard to deny Lisbons enhanced standard of living."
39,"You don't need to have a high income to start saving for retirement. There are effective ways for people with little money to begin to build wealth for the future. Here's how to invest for retirement with little money: Pay yourself first. Automate the process. Get a company match. Analyze your budget. Start saving something. Increase your income. Leverage windfalls. Learn how to invest. Pay Yourself First People with low funds looking to save money for retirement can build their net worth by paying themselves first. The first skill most people must learn is how to save, even if it is a small amount at first, but everyone should learn to save, says Mark Williams, chief executive officer at Brokers International in Atlanta. Paying yourself first is a key strategy to start building up a retirement fund on a low income. Automate the Process You can elect to have your retirement savings withheld from your paychecks so you are not tempted to spend it now. It's critically important to invest at least 10% of your current income for the future, says Craig Kirsner, president of retirement planning services at Kirsner Wealth Management in Coconut Creek, Florida. Over time that has the potential to grow substantially with the power of compound interest. Get a Company Match Your company might offer to match the funds you contribute to the company 401(k) plan. A typical 401(k) match is 50 cents for each dollar you save in the 401(k) plan, and some employers provide a dollar-for-dollar 401(k) match up to a certain amount. ""This means that you could instantly get up to a 100% return on your money on day one with that company match, Kirsner says. If your employer has a 401(k) or retirement plan that matches your financial contribution, make sure to take advantage of this valuable program. Analyze Your Budget Figure out where you stand financially. Understand where your money is being spent and what youre buying. Once we understand where and what we are spending on, we can look for possible places to stop the spend and start the save, Williams says. Often we find that eating out or buying a coffee from a coffee shop are easy things to do without, and we can start saving that money. Cutting out one $5 coffee a week saves over $20 a month. Once you've started saving, steer it directly into your retirement account. Many retirement account providers allow you to add funds via the company website or mobile app. Start Saving Something Get used to the idea of saving money. You can start gradually and keep building assets. ""Even $2 per week or $20 a month helps get you going,"" Williams says. ""It doesnt matter how much you save at first, at least. Learn to be a saver. Understand that money has the ability to earn money, so start learning about compound interest and the power of using pretax dollars like a 401(k) or IRA to help build wealth and lower taxes at the same time."" Increase Your Income If you don't want to cut back, you could also take steps to improve your income. As you get raises and move up in your career, remember to put aside some of those funds for retirement. Increasing income can never hurt, but it's less important than you think,"" says Brennan Schlagbaum, founder of Budgetdog, a financial consulting firm in Cincinnati. Anyone can build wealth. It really comes down to having a good financial plan. Leverage Windfalls Another manageable savings method is to consider saving part of an inheritance or a tax refund. Each time you receive a significant lump sum, consider depositing a portion of it in a retirement account. Learn How to Invest You don't need to become a financial expert before you start saving for retirement, but learning more about personal finance can help you to become a better retirement investor. ""That investment may come in taking classes, apprenticeships, retirement and investment boot camps or meeting with a trusted financial advisor,"" says Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner in Water Valley, Mississippi. ""Check with your local department of labor, unemployment office or similar workplace development program. They often have educational programs that are free of charge."""
40,"Recent cryptocurrency downturns have wiped out huge amounts of wealth. Cryptocurrencies have had a rough start to the year. As of May 12, Bitcoin (BTC) had lost nearly 40% in value year to date, while Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) were each down about 48% in that period. These are the three biggest cryptocurrencies in circulation by market capitalization  not counting stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which are meant to be tied to the U.S. dollar. This isn't the first time crypto has taken a big dive. From mid-May to mid-July 2021, cryptos went through another big drop, and Bitcoin fell more than 45%. Despite the volatility, many investors are still interested in cryptocurrencies. According to Vin Narayanan, vice president of strategy at Early Investing, ""As crypto adoption increases, it'll become more stable."" Until then, however, investors may want to know what to look for so they don't get burned by crypto crashes. Here are six reasons why cryptocurrencies crash. Crypto investors taking on too much leverage. Crypto data firm CryptoQuant's BTC leverage ratio hit all-time highs in early January, meaning more investors were taking on risk in the crypto space. Just like in traditional markets, crypto investors will often use debt to finance purchases of futures. This can be a way for miners to hedge against future price drops in the coins they're mining. Simon Peters, senior account manager at eToro, says these amounts of leverage ""could spell volatility in the near term"" for cryptocurrencies. As with any asset class, Peters says, ""price declines could cause liquidation of long-term positions."" Then, as prices drop and futures holders start liquidating their positions, prices could fall even further. It's a cycle similar to what happened to the stock market in 1929 and 2008. But these kinds of crashes are particularly dangerous for markets like crypto that don't have much liquidity. Lack of liquidity in cryptocurrency markets. The biggest problem the crypto markets face when leveraged investors liquidate a large portion of their assets is the overall liquidity of the markets. Unlike in the stock market, there aren't always a bunch of buyers waiting to snatch up unloaded coins. This is part of the reason why crashes tend to occur over weekends for crypto. There are fewer investors tuned in to buy when a bunch of coins are sold. Narayanan says, ""It's why big institutions can't trade small coins. They wind up upsetting the markets."" For example, when a whale  an investor who holds a large position of any given asset  sells significant amounts of crypto, it can flood the market. The coins simply funnel into the broader market and leave a glut of supply with limited demand. Cryptocurrency regulation. When China banned crypto mining in June 2021, ""miners had to move to other jurisdictions that were more miner-friendly,"" Peters says. The implications for crypto investors were that ""we saw a significant decline in the network hash rate."" In the crypto world, a hash rate is the number of calculations that can be performed per second. These calculations are what allow the miners to produce the coins they're mining, and they affect a coin's price. When prices decline, the hash rate declines. It's been theorized that the opposite holds true, as well. This is often because miners are paid in cryptocurrency. But this also means that when governments clamp down on mining through regulations, the overall price of cryptos can decline. Crypto security breaches causing fear. Blockchain and network security are other factors that could cause a crypto crash, Peters says. This kind of crash would unfold similarly to regulatory disruptions from government actors. For example, if it appeared that there was a security flaw in Bitcoin, that would affect the desire to mine it, which could affect the hash rate and overall price. ""This is a new asset class,"" Narayanan says. ""There's only going to be a certain amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist."" And unlike with stocks, which are supported by underlying assets, the value of most cryptocurrencies is driven purely by investor sentiment. ""The challenge for investors who wish to hold cryptocurrency is to find those that have limited supply and enduring appeal,"" says Dan Kemp, global chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management. Crypto influencers causing volatility. When it comes to sentiment, Peters says cryptocurrency investors need to keep in mind that ""crypto advocates and key influencers can tweet and cause an inflow of capital."" Obviously, we've seen this happen with Elon Musk's support of Dogecoin. Tweeting can have the opposite effect, as well. This is due to the value of this asset class being based on investor sentiment and to crypto's lack of liquidity. For investors, a possible antidote to this problem is stablecoins. Traders can use this type of coin to easily move in and out of other crypto positions as the market shifts. Cryptocurrency correlations with the stock market. Part of the beauty of crypto is that it should be an uncorrelated asset. In other words, it should float freely, divorced from the rest of the market. But, as 2022 has proven, that's often not the case. ""Crypto markets have become more intertwined with traditional markets due to traditional adoption over the past few years. Crypto has a high correlation to the stock market in some people's views,"" says Peters. Crypto, once supposedly the world's newest hedge against interest rates and inflation, is proving far more correlated to overall markets than early adopters hoped. Look no further than the crypto market's 45.3% plunge year to date through May 12 compared to the S&P 500's 17.5% decline. The fact that this plunge comes alongside rising rates doesn't help make the case that it's uncorrelated. But, as Narayanan says, ""Crypto crashes are part of investing in crypto."" What investors need to determine is their time frame for holding digital assets and whether they can stomach market downturns."
41,"Analysts recommend these inflation stocks. The stock market jumped when the U.S. Labor Department reported the consumer price index grew 8.5% year over year in the month of July, down from a 9.1% advance in June. Inflation may have finally peaked, but the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to raise interest rates until inflation is back near its long-term target of 2%. Bank of America recently compiled a pro-inflation stock screen to identify stocks that have historically demonstrated a strong positive correlation with inflation. While other companies battle rising costs, inflation may actually help these stocks outperform. Here are seven inflation investments for investors looking to protect their portfolios Mosaic Co. (ticker: MOS) Mosaic produces concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients for the agricultural industry. Analyst Steve Byrne says Mosaic's second-quarter earnings numbers were in line with his expectations. Fertilizer prices hit record highs in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but Byrne projects phosphate and potash prices will pull back in the second half of 2022. Mosaic management recently said it plans to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders. Byrne expects $2 billion in buybacks and says there is potential for a special dividend as well. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $88 price target for MOS stock, which closed at $60.69 on Aug. 24. APA Corp. (APA) Formerly known as Apache, APA is a major U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company. Analyst Doug Leggate says APA returned 43% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the first half of 2022 and is positioned to accelerate its share buybacks in the second half of the year. Leggate says APA's second quarter was ""messy"" and its guidance was ""light,"" but the value of APA's cash flow makes the stock one of the most undervalued U.S. exploration and production stocks in the market. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $62 price target for APA stock, which closed at $40.31 on Aug. 24. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Applied Materials is the world's leading producer of wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry. Analyst Vivek Arya says wafer fab equipment spending will decline 5% in 2023. However, Applied Materials' fiscal fourth-quarter guidance exceeded expectations and its Semi Systems segment growth is accelerating. In addition, Arya says the company's gross margins have expanded since bottoming in July and the company's commitment to aggressive share buybacks should help support the stock. Applied Materials' logic and foundry growth and 20% free cash flow margins are also impressive. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $125 price target for AMAT stock, which closed at $101.48 on Aug. 24. Halliburton Co. (HAL) Halliburton is a leading U.S. oilfield services company. Analyst Chase Mulvehill says strong operating leverage, pricing power and disciplined spending are all tail winds for Halliburton. Halliburton's international revenues were up 20% in the first half of the year, and Mulvehill says the company will continue to report strong growth numbers into 2023. Mulvehill projects 2022 free cash flow, or FCF, of $1.5 billion and 2023 FCF of $2.7 billion. He says the company can also raise its dividend to pre-pandemic levels in the medium term. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $35 price target for HAL stock, which closed at $31.66 on Aug. 24. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices produces personal computer central processing units and graphics processing units, as well as server chips for data centers. AMD management is confident about the company's data center growth opportunities and the benefits of integrating Xilinx into its operations. Arya is also bullish on AMD's conservative outlook for the personal computing market and its pricing discipline. AMD shares trade at just 21.6 times Arya's 2023 earnings per share projections, an attractive valuation for a stock that reported 70.1% revenue growth in the most recent quarter. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $120 price target for AMD stock, which closed at $92.73 on Aug. 24. SVB Financial Group (SIVB) SVB Financial is the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, a commercial bank that specializes in technology, life sciences, wineries, and private equity and venture capital firms. Through Aug. 24, SVB shares are down 37% in 2022 on concerns that plummeting tech sector valuations could hit SVB's early-stage venture capital and private equity customers. Analyst Ebrahim Poonawala says the sharp correction in tech company valuations coupled with SVB's second-quarter earnings miss and guidance cut has understandably spooked investors. However, he says SVB's core business model remains one of the best in the banking industry. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $525 price target for SIVB stock, which closed at $429.50 on Aug. 24. Tapestry Inc. (TPR) Tapestry is the parent company of luxury brands Coach, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman. The company produces accessories, handbags, footwear, fragrances and other products. Rising prices will likely not deter Tapestry's high-end customer base. Analyst Lorraine Hutchinson says Kate Spade, Coach and Stuart Weitzman generated impressive average unit retail growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, and Tapestry's overall revenue growth should be stronger in the second half of the year as the China market recovers. China sales were down 32% in the fourth quarter. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $50 price target for TPR stock, which closed at $36.03 on Aug. 24."
42,"The Story Running a bank is simple, right? You raise deposits. You mobilize funds. You lend some money out and you keep the interest. And as long as you keep doling out money to creditworthy individuals who pay you back in time, youll be good as gold. You just need to keep repeating this simple maxim. Seems easy enough, no? Well, tell that to the shareholders of 95-year-old Kerala-based Dhanlaxmi Bank. The banks share price has crashed by 93% since 2010. Its almost a penny stock now (below ?10). Meaning if you has invested ?1 lakh back in 2010, you would be left with a paltry sum of ?7,000 now. And last week, the shareholders had enough. They think that the CEO is spending money willy-nilly when the bank is already in dire straits. So they revolted. They now want to restrict his spending power. So if he wants to open new branches, that wont be possible. If he wants to upgrade the IT systems, thats a no go too. He can only pay staff salaries and he cant do much else. Thats harsh! Now heres the thingthis isnt the first time shareholders have revolted at Dhanlaxmi Bank. And it probably wont be the last. But to understand whats going on, we have to understand the legacy banks history. Since its inception in the 1920s, Dhanlaxmi Bank followed the basic principles of banking. Raise deposits. Lend money. Pocket the interest. And it did this quite well. It focused on building relationships with small businesses. It built up its retail book slowly and steadily. It stuck to its area of competence and didnt experiment all that much. But times change and the bank didnt want to be left behind. It wanted to change its image??from a sleepy old legacy bank to a nimble gazelle. It wanted to be tech-savvy. It wanted a pan-India presence. And in 2008, Amitabh Chaturvedi came on board to usher in a new era for the regional bank. He was someone whod risen through the ranks at ICICI Bank and then at Reliance Capital. Everyone believed he could bring private sector aggression into Dhanlaxmi. It worked. In just 3 years, the banks loan book grew from ?2,500 crores to ?10,100 crores. Its deposits surged from ?3,400 crores to ?13,800 crores. It opened 66 new branches across the country. And its employee strength tripled. Chaturvedi also did this by staying in the good books of the Trade Union. He raised salary levels, gave jobs to the employees children, and he even offered to relocate the Keralites working in other metros. Things were looking up. Oh, he actually changed the name of the bank??from Dhanalakshmi to Dhanlaxmi. Dont ask why! But all this came at a cost. And the cracks began to appear soon after. Expenses were rising out of line. Income began lagging behind. The old guard began retiring and new employees werent allowed to join the employees union. 3 years into his tenure, tensions flared up again. In October 2011, the employees union said that the top management was window-dressing the accounts. That they were finding novel ways to show profits. That they were recognising income that they didnt receive upfront, while staggering expenses over a period of time. The RBI got involved and began an investigation. After all, the capital adequacy ratio??a figure that tells you about the kind of money available to cushion against future losses, fell from 14.44% in 2011 to 10.81% in 2009. The bank was pursuing its expansionary goals too quickly by spreading itself too thin. The Banks board stopped backing Chaturvedi. They wanted him to cease the wanton expansion and cut back on lending. And he did. Soon, income dried up, while the costs remained elevated. Chaturvedi really had no option but to quit the bank. And by August 2012, its auditor Walker Chandiok and Co. threw its hands in the air and resigned too. Something to do with financial irregularities. Things were so bad that in 2015, the RBI stepped in. The regulator placed the bank under something called the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Being put on this list is usually bad news. Sure, the objective is to ensure that the bank protects its capital and does not go bust. But it also means restrictions on lending out money. You know, the very things that pad the coffers. And it took nearly 4 years for the bank to get its financial act together and become a free bird again. Well, sort of. Because financial matters are one thing. But what if theres another problem? The elephant in the room??Culture. For a Kerala-based legacy bank trying to find its feet in the new world, the biggest hurdle was preserving the culture built so painstakingly over the years. You see, between 2003 and 2020, the Bank had 7 CEOs. And 5 of them did not last their full term. Even seasoned Board members jumped ship citing problems with the management and a toothless board. And when in 2020, the RBI appointed Sunil Gurbaxani as the CEO, shareholders waited just 6 months before ousting him. Apparently, he was making the same mistakes as his predecessors??ignoring the banks South Indian roots in the quest for growth. At that time, the general secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association wrote to the RBI Governor. His request was simple??Please find a person who understands the banks history. Its legacy. Its customers and shareholders. Or, as one expert told Forbes, Essentially, the problem is that Dhanlaxmi is a Kerala-based bank, and as management, you really need to understand the local sentiments. You need to behave and act like a local to win over the shareholders which had been missing for many years. Running a bank isnt so simple after all. Being overly aggressive is one thing, but, you need to cater to sentiments too it seems. Especially if youre an outsider who has been brought in to run the show. Youre beholden to the shareholders and their whims and fancies. So you could argue that shareholders ought to be selecting the top brass then? And they kind of did. The next appointment was Kerala-based banking veteran J K Shivan. In fact, the RBI actually asked the banks board to get support from the shareholders before appointing him. Which they did. 99.81% of the shareholders gave the green light. But barely 1.5 years later, its the same J K Shivan whos facing the ire of shareholders. Its his powers they want to curtail now. So now the question is??if an RBI-appointed person isnt good enough; if someone the shareholders chose is also not good enough; whats next for the bank thats clinging on to its DNA? Also, how responsible is the RBI for this mess??You see, the RBI has nominees on the board of the bank too and its being accused of sleeping at the wheel. How will Dhanlaxmi Bank get out of this mess? The simple answer is that it needs to urgently raise capital to get its house in order. But it also needs to sort out the constant battle among the shareholders, board, and management. If that doesnt happen, it wont be the last time you hear about troubles at the 95-year-old Dhanlaxmi Bank."

44,"The Story India has a relatively open economy. Trade goes on unimpeded in most cases and the government doesnt intervene as much. However, in a market this massive and diverse, not everyone plays fair. In some cases, they deliberately flout rules. In other situations, they amass significant influence in the market and monopolize it entirely. This dominance affects competition and consumers alike. New players struggle to prosper and consumers have to settle for limited options. Thats why we have the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The CCI believes in a very simple mantra??Customers reign supreme. And it's the commissions job to make sure everyone in the market abides by this little maxim. They also make sure no player has any undue advantage when it comes to controlling the supply of goods and services, manipulating prices or restricting the growth of other players. So if youre an e-commerce marketplace thats forcing suppliers to sell below cost on your platform, the CCI is coming for you. If youre a cement giant thats colluding with other manufacturers in the industry to restrict supply and hike prices, youll be hearing from the CCI. If youre looking to acquire another company of substantial stature and size, you cant do it unless the CCI signs off on the deal. In summary, the CCI squashes unfair practices and monopolistic tendencies to make sure customers dont have to suffer by way of unreasonably high prices, lack of options or inferior quality products. With that introduction out of the way, lets get to CCIs issue with Google. Okay, so there are two orders here. The first order tackles Googles dominance in the operating systems (OS) market and the search services domain. About 95% of all smartphones in India run on Android. And Android happens to be an open-source operating system. Meaning developers can modify and share the design since its publicly accessible. However, if you intended to make your version accessible to people, then youd have to tie up with phone manufacturers??the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi. But this isnt possible since Google puts in place restrictions that prevent manufacturers from experimenting too much. For instance, if a manufacturer intended to use Googles proprietary apps (such as Google Maps), then they were forced to use Googles version of Android. They also had to carry Googles search widget, the Chrome Browser, and an entire suite of applications without offering users the ability to uninstall them. So in summary, phone manufacturers have to feature Googles suite of applications, prominently in some cases. Developers are excluded entirely from distributing their version of the operating system because Google has in place agreements that prevent phone manufacturers from carrying these alternatives. And they also have exclusive revenue-sharing agreements with phone manufacturers specifically catered to Googles search services. This prevents other search services from making a dent. This, the CCI believes inhibits competition and affects user experience. So they slapped a heavy fine and asked Google to do away with these restrictive agreements. The second order focused on Google's app store. An app store is a medium of distribution. If youre a developer and you want to create a dating app for millennials, then youd likely want to list the program on an app store to make it accessible to users. And Googles app store, called the Play Store is the most dominant alternative in the market. However, if youre listing an app on the Play Store you have to play by Googles rules. Consider the hypothetical dating app you just built. Its free to use. But if users wanted preferential access, you could impose a small fee. Its a neat little monetisation model. But Googles Play Store policies will require you to exclusively use Google Plays Billing System for receiving payments. You cant use alternative payment methods or redirect the user to a different website where they could potentially make the payment. Its a diktat imposed on every app and theres no getting out of it. Through this Google charges a service fee of 1530%. Meanwhile, traditional payment processors charge a transaction fee of roughly 13%. Its insane. And like we noted, developers cant do away with this restriction. Its a take it or leave it offer. You either list on Play Store, pay the 30% commission and do business. Or you stay out. But it gets worse when you consider that Google doesnt impose this restriction on everyone. Take YouTube??Googles own app. YouTube has been given the liberty to use third party billing systems and bypass the 30% commission rate altogether. But a different video sharing app, say Moj, has to put up the 30% commission when they pay creators who regularly post interesting stuff on the app. So YouTube doesnt always have to pay the 30% commission. But Moj does? It makes Moj uncompetitive. It doesn't give them an even platform and CCI believes this is patently unfair, especially when you consider that Google controls the so called ""Platform"".

45,"The Story India has a relatively open economy. Trade goes on unimpeded in most cases and the government doesnt intervene as much. However, in a market this massive and diverse, not everyone plays fair. In some cases, they deliberately flout rules. In other situations, they amass significant influence in the market and monopolize it entirely. This dominance affects competition and consumers alike. New players struggle to prosper and consumers have to settle for limited options. Thats why we have the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The CCI believes in a very simple mantra??Customers reign supreme. And it's the commissions job to make sure everyone in the market abides by this little maxim. They also make sure no player has any undue advantage when it comes to controlling the supply of goods and services, manipulating prices or restricting the growth of other players. So if youre an e-commerce marketplace thats forcing suppliers to sell below cost on your platform, the CCI is coming for you. If youre a cement giant thats colluding with other manufacturers in the industry to restrict supply and hike prices, youll be hearing from the CCI. If youre looking to acquire another company of substantial stature and size, you cant do it unless the CCI signs off on the deal. In summary, the CCI squashes unfair practices and monopolistic tendencies to make sure customers dont have to suffer by way of unreasonably high prices, lack of options or inferior quality products. With that introduction out of the way, lets get to CCIs issue with Google. Okay, so there are two orders here. The first order tackles Googles dominance in the operating systems (OS) market and the search services domain. About 95% of all smartphones in India run on Android. And Android happens to be an open-source operating system. Meaning developers can modify and share the design since its publicly accessible. However, if you intended to make your version accessible to people, then youd have to tie up with phone manufacturers??the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi. But this isnt possible since Google puts in place restrictions that prevent manufacturers from experimenting too much. For instance, if a manufacturer intended to use Googles proprietary apps (such as Google Maps), then they were forced to use Googles version of Android. They also had to carry Googles search widget, the Chrome Browser, and an entire suite of applications without offering users the ability to uninstall them. So in summary, phone manufacturers have to feature Googles suite of applications, prominently in some cases. Developers are excluded entirely from distributing their version of the operating system because Google has in place agreements that prevent phone manufacturers from carrying these alternatives. And they also have exclusive revenue-sharing agreements with phone manufacturers specifically catered to Googles search services. This prevents other search services from making a dent. This, the CCI believes inhibits competition and affects user experience. So they slapped a heavy fine and asked Google to do away with these restrictive agreements. The second order focused on Google's app store. An app store is a medium of distribution. If youre a developer and you want to create a dating app for millennials, then youd likely want to list the program on an app store to make it accessible to users. And Googles app store, called the Play Store is the most dominant alternative in the market. However, if youre listing an app on the Play Store you have to play by Googles rules. Consider the hypothetical dating app you just built. Its free to use. But if users wanted preferential access, you could impose a small fee. Its a neat little monetisation model. But Googles Play Store policies will require you to exclusively use Google Plays Billing System for receiving payments. You cant use alternative payment methods or redirect the user to a different website where they could potentially make the payment. Its a diktat imposed on every app and theres no getting out of it. Through this Google charges a service fee of 1530%. Meanwhile, traditional payment processors charge a transaction fee of roughly 13%. Its insane. And like we noted, developers cant do away with this restriction. Its a take it or leave it offer. You either list on Play Store, pay the 30% commission and do business. Or you stay out. But it gets worse when you consider that Google doesnt impose this restriction on everyone. Take YouTube??Googles own app. YouTube has been given the liberty to use third party billing systems and bypass the 30% commission rate altogether. But a different video sharing app, say Moj, has to put up the 30% commission when they pay creators who regularly post interesting stuff on the app. So YouTube doesnt always have to pay the 30% commission. But Moj does? It makes Moj uncompetitive. It doesn't give them an even platform and CCI believes this is patently unfair, especially when you consider that Google controls the so called ""Platform"". So they imposed a combined fine of ?2,274 crores and asked Google to stop imposing these restrictions altogether. No more gatekeeping, no more exclusive billing systems and no more abuse of dominance. What will happen next? Google will challenge this order in all likelihood. And we will have to see what happens."
46,"The Story There are about 20 quadrillion ants in the world. Thats 20 followed by 15 zeroes. 2.5 million ants for every human on the planet. And theyve existed for over 150 million years. And yet, they are not hellbent on taking the world. But waitwhy are we talking about ants today? Their life isnt all that interesting. Theyre insignificant in the grand scheme of things and they make a beeline every time you drop a piece of ladoo. That doesnt sound very fascinating, no? NO! Ants are fascinating creatures. They can carry 50 times their own body weight. They are as old as dinosaurs. They are extremely rugged and theyre great at collaborative work. They can farm, they own slaves and they are ecosystem engineers. They turn the soil, aerate it and theyre single-handedly responsible for dispersing some kinds of seeds. Without ants, this world would be a boring place. And weve known this for a while. In 1915, Walter Swingle, a physiologist from the US visited Canton city (now Guangzhou) in China to find an orange variety resistant to citrus canker??a pest-induced disease that affects citrus fruits like orange, lemon and grapefruit. And he was seeking this special orange variant because citrus canker was wreaking havoc in Florida at the time. It was destroying the crop. So he collaborated with another researcher, George Groff and his students from Lingnan University in a bid to study citrus orchards. And thats when they chanced on a small village that lived off ants i.e. most families sold ants for a living. Now at the time, the researchers laughed at this absurdity. They hadnt expected this at all. The village boasted mulberry trees and silkworms and they believed this would have been the communitys primary occupation. But that wasnt the case. Instead, people here cultivated silkworms and fed them to citrus ants. These ants were then sold to orange growers for a dollar a nest. Why? Because ants are excellent ""pest control"". They feasted on most things that affected crop yield. And the ants kept those orange plants healthy. In China, orange growers have used ants to keep their crops pest free since at least 304 CE. But of course, things changed in the 1950s. Pesticides entered the fray and offered significant improvements in crop yields by 30%-40%. However, it masked the real cost of pesticide use. It discounted the impact on health, compromised water, soil quality, and even loss of biodiversity. Think frogs for instance. They do some pest control too. But weve been losing these helpful amphibians, partly due to pesticides. Were currently losing them at a rate of 3.7% every year. Or look at vanishing bees. Bees are natural pollinators and 75% of the worlds crops depend on them to some extent. But what happens if they die out? It affects crop output and could be a threat to global food security. Whats more? Pesticides even find their way into drinking water. The World Health Organization says that pesticides are among the leading causes of death by self-poisoning, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Pesticides are bad. Plain and simple. And heres where ants come in once again. In Punjab, researchers compared the yields of mango and citrus trees with and without ant nests. And they found that trees with ant nests produced 18% and 20% higher yields than trees without nests in mango and citrus, respectively. In Malaysian oil palms, researchers found that ants preyed on bagworm pests that ate up foliage. Palms with ant nests also produced more fruits. So theres some evidence to show that ants could be a viable alternative for pesticides at least in some cases. But theres something else too. An unintended benefit. You see, ants are actually a novel source of protein. Sure, they can improve crop yields and fruit quality but you can also harvest the surplus larvae sustainably without affecting the ant population. Its a win-win for everyone (except those ants, of course) So yeah, its definitely good news that we have a battalion of ants on the planet. Now we just have to put them to good use, no?"

50,"Britain's new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Tuesday he would try to fix the mess left by his predecessor, restore faith in politics and tackle a ""profound economic crisis"" but warned the country there would be difficult decisions. Standing in front of his Downing Street office, Sunak paid tribute to Liz Truss, whose economic programme roiled the markets, saying the mistakes she made were not ""born of ill will or bad intentions"". He also took aim at another predecessor, Boris Johnson, by saying the mandate the Conservatives were handed at the 2019 election won by the former prime minister was not the property of one individual, and he would be guided by its promises. ""I want to pay tribute to my predecessor Liz Truss ... Some mistakes were made. Not born of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite in fact. But mistakes nonetheless,"" he said. ""And I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister, in part to fix them. And that work begins immediately. I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda. This will mean difficult decisions to come."" Appealing to a pubic facing rising energy and food prices, Sunak, one of the wealthiest lawmakers in parliament, said he fully appreciated how hard things were for many. ""All I can say is that I am not daunted. I know the high office I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands,"" he said. ""So I stand here before you ready to lead our country into the future. To put your needs above politics, to reach out and build a government that represents the very best traditions of my party.

Standing in front of his Downing Street office, Sunak paid tribute to Liz Truss, whose economic programme roiled the markets, saying the mistakes she made were not ""born of ill will or bad intentions"". He also took aim at another predecessor, Boris Johnson, by saying the mandate the Conservatives were handed at the 2019 election won by the former prime minister was not the property of one individual, and he would be guided by its promises. ""I want to pay tribute to my predecessor Liz Truss ... Some mistakes were made. Not born of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite in fact. But mistakes nonetheless,"" he said. ""And I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister, in part to fix them. And that work begins immediately. I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda. This will mean difficult decisions to come."" Appealing to a pubic facing rising energy and food prices, Sunak, one of the wealthiest lawmakers in parliament, said he fully appreciated how hard things were for many. ""All I can say is that I am not daunted. I know the high office I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands,"" he said. ""So I stand here before you ready to lead our country into the future. To put your needs above politics, to reach out and build a government that represents the very best traditions of my party. Together we can achieve incredible things."""
53,"He Lifeng, head of China's state planning agency, is likely to succeed the country's economic tsar Vice Premier Liu He in March, but may struggle to maintain his predecessor's policy clout. He, 67, a confidant of President Xi Jinping, was elevated to the ruling Communist Party's Politburo during its once-every-five-years congress this month. That paves the way for He's expected promotion as the 70-year-old Liu is due to step down in March. The top priority for He will be to help Li Qiang - another Xi ally, tipped to become the new Premier in March - to pull the world's second-largest economy out of its worst downturn in decades amid disruptive COVID-19 curbs and a prolonged property crisis. The departing Liu, Xi's top economic adviser and a childhood friend, holds an unusually powerful portfolio: it covers economic policy, the financial sector and trade ties with Washington, overshadowing the role of outgoing Premier Li Keqiang. Xi, who secured a precedent-breaking third term as president at the party conclave, may want to restore some of the premiership's previous power under the incoming Li Qiang. Some analysts say part of the expanded role that Liu built up during his time as economic tsar could be taken over by other top officials. ""If He Lifeng does indeed get the job, his portfolio will overlap with that of the new Premier, Li Qiang,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. ""It remains to be seen who will have more influence in practice."" Liu, who has been vice premier since 2018, is seen by China watchers as the brains behind earlier reforms, including those to reduce excess factory capacity and financial risks. The Harvard-trained economist was also Xi's point person on trade negotiations with Washington, thanks to his international experience and fluent English. He Lifeng, a home-groomed economist and bureaucrat with close Xi ties, had worked for 25 years in Fujian province before moving to the northern municipality of Tianjin in 2009. His track record suggests he is likely to favour a more statist approach to economic management, Evans-Pritchard said. Serving under Xi in Fujian in the 1980s, He attended Xi's wedding ceremony when he married his second wife, the popular singer Peng Liyuan, sources have said. In 2014, He was named vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission - the state planning agency - before taking full control in 2017. Since then He has joined Xi on domestic tours, diplomatic meetings and other engagements. The expected departure of pro-reform officials, including Liu, top banking regulator Guo Shuqing and central bank chief Yi Gang, has raised concerns over the quality of policymaking as officials become increasingly focused on displays of loyalty to Xi and less on governance and economic performance. ""The chance of making policy mistakes will be greater if officials only talk about politics and do not follow economic rules,"" a policy source said, speaking on condition of anonymity."

56,"The World Economic Forum is looking to reduce global reliance on critical metals as nations look to make the transition to renewable energy supplies, and one proposal is reducing ownership of private vehicles. ""This transition from fossil fuels to renewables will need large supplies of critical metals such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, to name a few,"" the forum said in a report earlier this month. ""Shortages of these critical minerals could raise the costs of clean energy technologies."" The international lobbying organization based in Switzerland has proposed three solutions for lowering the costs of critical metals used in everything from cellphones and electric vehicles to wind turbines and efficient lighting. The forum noted that even with recycling initiatives in place mineral mining is expected to increase by 500% by 2050. ""More sharing can reduce ownership of idle equipment and thus material usage,"" the group argued, pointing to statistics that show the average vehicle in England is driven ""just 4% of the time."" Vehicle sharing initiatives like ""Getaround"" and ""BlueSG"" have become increasingly popular around the world and are key in reducing the number of cars and electronics needed globally, the forum argued. Though it did not address how car sharing could be more effectively utilized in a nation like the U.S. where cars are heavily relied on and public transportation is lacking in both rural and urban communities. The report also pointed out that most people around the world already have personal phones or computers but 39% of global workers are also provided laptops and mobile phones. ""This is not at all resource efficient,"" the report said. ""Keeping a smartphone for five years instead of three reduces the phones annual carbon footprint by 31%."" The report said companies need to be incentivized to reward consumer longevity and encourage product repurposing to prevent new mines from being opened."
58,"Some hints that U.S. price pressures are beginning to ease even as overall inflation remains high could encourage Federal Reserve policymakers to opt for smaller interest rate increases after they deliver a fourth straight supersized hike next week. While the Commerce Department reported on Friday that underlying inflation pressures remained stubbornly high last month, the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index showed a considerable slowdown in private-sector wage growth in the third quarter - it rose 1.2% compared to 1.6% in the second quarter - suggesting the likelihood of a scenario of ever-rising wages pushing prices higher may be receding. Fed policymakers are keenly attentive to the ECI as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation. ""Although another 75bp (basis point) rate hike lies in store next week, we suspect that slowdown (in wage growth) will help convince the Fed to slow the pace of tightening in December,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. With the U.S. central bank almost certain to lift its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range at its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, investors are now focused on what's coming in December and early 2023. Projections released last month showed policymakers' median forecast for the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 at 4.6%. Fed officials have said they expect to hit that level by early next year and several then want to pause, arguing that the economy will need time to absorb the fastest pace of tightening in 40 years and that an easing in inflation is likely to lag the rate hikes. Several policymakers in the last month have also appeared to be leaning toward a smaller rate hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate were little changed after the release of Friday's data, still pricing in a half-percentage-point hike next month and another 50 basis points over the first two meetings of next year. INFLATION STILL HIGH Whether the Fed will be able to stick to its preferred path of a pause around 4.6% remains to be seen. Certainly, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data did little to bolster central bank hopes that price pressures have decisively turned a corner. The PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure as it tracks progress in reducing inflation to its 2% target, increased 0.3% on a month-to-month basis and 6.2% on a year-to-year basis in September, matching the advances in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was up 0.5% in September, matching the gain in the prior month, and 5.1% in the 12 months through September, compared to a 4.9% year-on-year rise in August. That was enough for one analyst to argue the market is undershooting the amount of Fed tightening that remains. ""Inflation is still running way too hot, the month-on-month numbers are holding steady ... the numbers also show that the Fed is going to have to continue to raise rates and tighten probably longer than the market is pricing in currently,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors."

62,"Youve slept in, woken up to a tidy home, its quiet, and youve got the rest of the day to potter around, no interruptions. A child-free life is a good life. The message floats over a video that captures a scene of serene domesticity. Posted on TikTok a few days ago, it has already racked up more than 100,000 views. The videos creator, Danni childfree Duncan, is among those who have helped turn the decision not to have children into something of a movement, complete with its own hashtags (#childfreebychoice and #nothavingkids). There are thousands of other young women posting similar content, including Nina, who sarcastically challenges the notion that as a #childfreemillennial shes bound to feel sad and worthless, while playing a montage of her gloriously child-free travels to make her point. (Trigger warning: such videos are best avoided by exhausted parents in the throes of raising a family.) It would be easy to dismiss these posts as a social media craze; something young people do to fill their time. Except this craze is just one small part of a wider, and highly significant, demographic issue: across much of the world, birth rates are plummeting. On Nov 15 this year, the global population is expected to reach eight billion. The United Nations predicts it could grow to about 8.5 billion by 2030 before peaking at 10.4 billion in the 2080s. After that  and some predict it will happen 20 years earlier  the worlds population will start to fall. At a glance, you might conclude the greater cause for alarm is the impending arrival of even more people on our planet. As Population Matters, a UK charity warns, every additional person increases carbon emissions, not to mention demand on limited food and water resources, and ultimately pressure on borders and social security systems. But, as averages often do, the headline figures obscure a different story. The few decades of projected global population growth that remain will be driven by a small number of undeveloped countries, many in the Sahel region of Africa. In countries like Niger, which has the worlds highest fertility rate, economic conditions remain so harsh that women continue to have an average of six or more children in order to survive. In contrast, for most of the rest of the world  including Britain  its a baby bust. And its happening now. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), women born in 1975 had on average just 1.92 children. This compared with the average 2.08 children produced by their mothers generation (taken as women born in 1949) and is far below the 2.1 children needed for the existing population to replace itself. The picture is similar in most other developed countries. Last year, the French were urged to have more children after the number of births in the country slumped to its lowest level since the Second World War, with 1.83 children born per woman, compared with 2.02 more than a decade earlier. The birth rate in Spain also dropped to a historic low last year, hitting just 1.19 children born to every woman  a 29 per cent fall compared with a decade earlier. And in parts of Asia the situation is even worse. South Koreas fertility rate sank to its lowest ever in 2020, a meagre 0.84 children per woman, giving the country the lowest birth rate in the world. So drastic is the decline that populations are expected to halve by 2100 in more than 20 countries, including Spain, Portugal and Japan. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive, has called it one of the biggest risks to civilisation. But why, when living standards and freedoms have never been higher, are women across the globe having so few children or rejecting the concept of motherhood altogether? And what if anything can policymakers do to reverse the trend? Stresses, strains and changing attitudes There is no doubt governments are worried. Earlier this month, an unnamed cabinet minister suggested Britain might take its lead from Hungary, where women receive tax cuts for having more children. Bonk for Britain urged the headline in the Sun on Sunday, which quoted the minister saying: Look at the labour shortages we are suffering from. We need to have more children. The rate keeps falling. It does; but the reasons are many and varied, extending beyond the financial to changing social attitudes and modern lifestyles. It starts with economics. In undeveloped countries like Niger, where subsistence agriculture dominates, people have large numbers of children to help support the family and look after them in their old age. But, as countries develop, they all pass a point at which the birth rate begins to fall. Its the point at which it makes more economic sense to invest in the education of just a couple of children. With a doctor or lawyer in the family the future becomes a whole lot more secure. This typified northern hemisphere countries for the latter part of the last century but, more recently, development appears to have nudged things too far, disincentivising procreation. In many countries, including Britain, children have become very expensive to raise and, as Professor Geeta Nargund, president of the International Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction, wrote in a 2009 paper on declining birth rates in developed countries, children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost[s]. The 2007/08 financial crash didnt help. Particularly in Europe [this] led to unemployment [and] poor accumulation of wealth by young adults, says Lyman Stone, chief information officer at Demographic Intelligence. Economic stresses and spiralling house prices mean more couples will feel they cant afford children, he explains. Indeed, there is data to suggest that in many countries, including the UK, US, Japan and Germany, couples tend to have fewer children than they would like. But theres also a complex blend of cultural factors to consider. One of the biggest drivers is changing marital trends, says Stone. As people marry later and have children later, that leads to lower fertility. And among the reasons for later marriage is adults remaining in education for longer, he says. People tend not to get married until they have a certain level of stability, and [university] postpones that. As were creating a society that demands people have more years of [education], were postponing marriage and so postponing childbirth, and then people may have more difficulties conceiving because theyre getting older. Attitudes are important too. In the 1950s, as populations in the west boomed, the cult of the nuclear family took hold, with dad diligently working nine-to-five and mum raising the 2.4 children between keeping the house clean with an array of modern gadgets that  allegedly  took the drudgery out of housework. But we live in a different world now and Stone cites a trio of modern attitudes that work against parenthood. One is high-intensity parenting  which involves investing much time and money into each child. This Tiger Mother version of raising children puts prospective parents off, says Stone. Weve made parenting very hard these days, he says. Its treated like a research project: you have to read all these books, not feed them this, do feed them that. Parenting anxiety is a real reason people dont have kids. They think parenting is really hard. Then theres the rise of leisurism  lifestyles focused on leisure pursuits. In some of its surveys, Demographic Intelligence has asked respondents to agree or disagree with statements like Im working on myself right now, my hobbies are important to me and I want to have extra money so I can travel. We find a considerable share of people have leisurist mindsets, says Stone, so its very important to them to have a lot of leisure time, and time to focus on their own wellbeing and development. We find that with people who have these views, it negatively affects their fertility, meaning they desire fewer children and dont even have as many children as they desire. The reverse of the leisurist coin is the workist mindset, in which you value your job very highly as a source of meaning and purpose in your life. Like leisurism, it is not hugely compatible with parenthood. More than one study has suggested a correlation between workist attitudes  which Stone says are prevalent among a growing share of adults  and lower fertility. But its not just that the 1950s ideal of family life is fading. Today there is a fast-growing cohort that actively rejects the idea of having children. They are childfree by choice, and proud of it. 1950s family Credit: Harold M Lambert/ Getty A survey last year by the Pew Research Center in the US found a rising share of childless American adults said they were unlikely to ever start a family. Some 44 per cent of non-parents aged 18 to 49 fell into this category, up from 37 per cent in 2018. While some cited financial reasons, climate change or their lack of a partner as a reason, the majority (56 per cent) said they probably wouldnt have children because they just didnt want to. Its a group thats becoming more vocal. In 2015 and 2017, the NotMom Summit  billed as one of the worlds first major conferences for women without children  was held in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2021, Erin Spurling, a British woman in her mid-30s, created the Childfree Lounge, an online community for women without children. Having children should be a choice, not something you do because everyone else thinks you should, she told The Daily Telegraph after launching. Its not hard to find other British women who feel the same. Ive never wanted children and never wavered from that, says Beth McCloughlin, 45, a copywriter from south-east London. I love my freedom, spontaneity and peace and quiet. I value time alone. I have a low tolerance of routine and mundane tasks. She echoes the frustration felt by many like her, at being asked to explain herself for straying from the default expectation for women. When people ask me if I never wanted children and why, I feel like theyd just asked me why Ive never chosen to be an astronaut or move to Iraq. I simply never felt the urge to do so and tolerate the sacrifices. Gail Hugman from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, founder of education business Lessons Alive, always knew she didnt want her own children. Every childbearing year of my life, I would ask myself if I was sure about the decision, she says. And in fleeting moments of regret, I know in my heart it was the right one. Pronatal planning Policymakers beg to differ. Worried by demographic headwinds, a number of countries have launched pronatalist initiatives. These are often financial in nature, such as the family allowance offered by the French state to families with at least two children under 20 (the amount of which varies by income), or the tax exemption for mothers of four or more in Hungary. Polands Family 500+ programme offers parents a tax-free benefit of 500 Polish zloty (£91) per month for their second and any subsequent children. In Seoul, South Korea, pregnant women receive rewards of 700,000 won (£436) in transportation vouchers. Singapore, facing a steep decline in its birth rate, has even tried matchmaking couples in the hope of socially engineering a baby boom. Other pronatalist policies focus on childcare provision and parental leave, with the Nordic nations often praised for their generous support. In Sweden, every pre-school child is entitled to childcare from age one, the cost of which is capped. In Norway, the maximum price for kindergarten is 3,050 kroner (£255) a month. In London, by contrast, it is not unusual to pay upwards of £1,000 a month for a private nursery. Given British childcare is among the most expensive in the world, costs here inevitably affect family planning. Recent research by Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity aimed at ending pregnancy and maternity discrimination, found almost one in five women who had had an abortion cited childcare prices as the main reason. Thus far, British policies have not exactly screamed please have more children. In 2017, the Conservative government introduced a two-child limit that restricted some benefit payments to the first two children born to the poorest households. Child benefits are also tapered if the higher earning parent makes more than £50,000, and removed completely if they earn above £60,000. Given the UKs population is on course to peak at 75 million in 2063 and predicted to fall to 71 million by 2100, is it time we followed the lead of other countries in adopting a pronatal approach? The reality is that initiatives elsewhere have had a limited effect. Birth rates are still falling. Following the introduction of Polands 500+ scheme in 2016, they did rise, but not enough to offset the problems of an ageing population. Pronatalist policies, moreover, raise some uneasy questions: should the state really have a role in influencing womens decisions about their bodies? Doesnt it have touches of Brave New World or The Handmaids Tale? And do such policies even have racist overtones? There was, youll recall, a party in the 1930s that wanted to increase indigenous births to grow its so-called Aryan population. But countries with shrinking working populations start to rely on immigration  and this brings problems of its own. Today, some on the Far Right subscribe to the great replacement theory  the ethno-nationalist idea that white populations are being supplanted by non-white immigrants. Extremists like Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people when he attacked two mosques in New Zealand in 2019, have used it to justify violence. Any treatment or discussion of the birth-rate problem requires, then, a sensitive and careful approach. Introducing pronatalist policies worth having for their own sake, aside from their possible effect on procreation, could be a way forward. In general its good to provide broad structural support for child-rearing, such as a generous child allowance, says Stone. [And] we need to make sure housing is affordable. There may even be positives, with technology allowing societies to exist with fewer workers and less stress being placed on the environment. In his recent book Decline and Prosper!  Changing Global Birth Rates and the Advantages of Fewer Children, demographic expert Vegard Skirbekk presents the baby bust as a positive overall. We must, he argues, ultimately adapt to a world with fewer children."

A child-free life is a good life. The message floats over a video that captures a scene of serene domesticity. Posted on TikTok a few days ago, it has already racked up more than 100,000 views. The videos creator, Danni childfree Duncan, is among those who have helped turn the decision not to have children into something of a movement, complete with its own hashtags (#childfreebychoice and #nothavingkids). There are thousands of other young women posting similar content, including Nina, who sarcastically challenges the notion that as a #childfreemillennial shes bound to feel sad and worthless, while playing a montage of her gloriously child-free travels to make her point. (Trigger warning: such videos are best avoided by exhausted parents in the throes of raising a family.) It would be easy to dismiss these posts as a social media craze; something young people do to fill their time. Except this craze is just one small part of a wider, and highly significant, demographic issue: across much of the world, birth rates are plummeting. On Nov 15 this year, the global population is expected to reach eight billion. The United Nations predicts it could grow to about 8.5 billion by 2030 before peaking at 10.4 billion in the 2080s. After that  and some predict it will happen 20 years earlier  the worlds population will start to fall. At a glance, you might conclude the greater cause for alarm is the impending arrival of even more people on our planet. As Population Matters, a UK charity warns, every additional person increases carbon emissions, not to mention demand on limited food and water resources, and ultimately pressure on borders and social security systems. But, as averages often do, the headline figures obscure a different story. The few decades of projected global population growth that remain will be driven by a small number of undeveloped countries, many in the Sahel region of Africa. In countries like Niger, which has the worlds highest fertility rate, economic conditions remain so harsh that women continue to have an average of six or more children in order to survive. In contrast, for most of the rest of the world  including Britain  its a baby bust. And its happening now. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), women born in 1975 had on average just 1.92 children. This compared with the average 2.08 children produced by their mothers generation (taken as women born in 1949) and is far below the 2.1 children needed for the existing population to replace itself. The picture is similar in most other developed countries. Last year, the French were urged to have more children after the number of births in the country slumped to its lowest level since the Second World War, with 1.83 children born per woman, compared with 2.02 more than a decade earlier. The birth rate in Spain also dropped to a historic low last year, hitting just 1.19 children born to every woman  a 29 per cent fall compared with a decade earlier. And in parts of Asia the situation is even worse. South Koreas fertility rate sank to its lowest ever in 2020, a meagre 0.84 children per woman, giving the country the lowest birth rate in the world. So drastic is the decline that populations are expected to halve by 2100 in more than 20 countries, including Spain, Portugal and Japan. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive, has called it one of the biggest risks to civilisation. But why, when living standards and freedoms have never been higher, are women across the globe having so few children or rejecting the concept of motherhood altogether? And what if anything can policymakers do to reverse the trend? Stresses, strains and changing attitudes There is no doubt governments are worried. Earlier this month, an unnamed cabinet minister suggested Britain might take its lead from Hungary, where women receive tax cuts for having more children. Bonk for Britain urged the headline in the Sun on Sunday, which quoted the minister saying: Look at the labour shortages we are suffering from. We need to have more children. The rate keeps falling. It does; but the reasons are many and varied, extending beyond the financial to changing social attitudes and modern lifestyles. It starts with economics. In undeveloped countries like Niger, where subsistence agriculture dominates, people have large numbers of children to help support the family and look after them in their old age. But, as countries develop, they all pass a point at which the birth rate begins to fall. Its the point at which it makes more economic sense to invest in the education of just a couple of children. With a doctor or lawyer in the family the future becomes a whole lot more secure. This typified northern hemisphere countries for the latter part of the last century but, more recently, development appears to have nudged things too far, disincentivising procreation. In many countries, including Britain, children have become very expensive to raise and, as Professor Geeta Nargund, president of the International Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction, wrote in a 2009 paper on declining birth rates in developed countries, children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost[s]. The 2007/08 financial crash didnt help. Particularly in Europe [this] led to unemployment [and] poor accumulation of wealth by young adults, says Lyman Stone, chief information officer at Demographic Intelligence. Economic stresses and spiralling house prices mean more couples will feel they cant afford children, he explains. Indeed, there is data to suggest that in many countries, including the UK, US, Japan and Germany, couples tend to have fewer children than they would like. But theres also a complex blend of cultural factors to consider. One of the biggest drivers is changing marital trends, says Stone. As people marry later and have children later, that leads to lower fertility. And among the reasons for later marriage is adults remaining in education for longer, he says. People tend not to get married until they have a certain level of stability, and [university] postpones that. As were creating a society that demands people have more years of [education], were postponing marriage and so postponing childbirth, and then people may have more difficulties conceiving because theyre getting older. Attitudes are important too. In the 1950s, as populations in the west boomed, the cult of the nuclear family took hold, with dad diligently working nine-to-five and mum raising the 2.4 children between keeping the house clean with an array of modern gadgets that  allegedly  took the drudgery out of housework. But we live in a different world now and Stone cites a trio of modern attitudes that work against parenthood. One is high-intensity parenting  which involves investing much time and money into each child. This Tiger Mother version of raising children puts prospective parents off, says Stone. Weve made parenting very hard these days, he says. Its treated like a research project: you have to read all these books, not feed them this, do feed them that. Parenting anxiety is a real reason people dont have kids. They think parenting is really hard. Then theres the rise of leisurism  lifestyles focused on leisure pursuits. In some of its surveys, Demographic Intelligence has asked respondents to agree or disagree with statements like Im working on myself right now, my hobbies are important to me and I want to have extra money so I can travel. We find a considerable share of people have leisurist mindsets, says Stone, so its very important to them to have a lot of leisure time, and time to focus on their own wellbeing and development. We find that with people who have these views, it negatively affects their fertility, meaning they desire fewer children and dont even have as many children as they desire. The reverse of the leisurist coin is the workist mindset, in which you value your job very highly as a source of meaning and purpose in your life. Like leisurism, it is not hugely compatible with parenthood. More than one study has suggested a correlation between workist attitudes  which Stone says are prevalent among a growing share of adults  and lower fertility. But its not just that the 1950s ideal of family life is fading. Today there is a fast-growing cohort that actively rejects the idea of having children. They are childfree by choice, and proud of it. 1950s family Credit: Harold M Lambert/ Getty A survey last year by the Pew Research Center in the US found a rising share of childless American adults said they were unlikely to ever start a family. Some 44 per cent of non-parents aged 18 to 49 fell into this category, up from 37 per cent in 2018. While some cited financial reasons, climate change or their lack of a partner as a reason, the majority (56 per cent) said they probably wouldnt have children because they just didnt want to. Its a group thats becoming more vocal. In 2015 and 2017, the NotMom Summit  billed as one of the worlds first major conferences for women without children  was held in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2021, Erin Spurling, a British woman in her mid-30s, created the Childfree Lounge, an online community for women without children. Having children should be a choice, not something you do because everyone else thinks you should, she told The Daily Telegraph after launching. Its not hard to find other British women who feel the same. Ive never wanted children and never wavered from that, says Beth McCloughlin, 45, a copywriter from south-east London. I love my freedom, spontaneity and peace and quiet. I value time alone. I have a low tolerance of routine and mundane tasks. She echoes the frustration felt by many like her, at being asked to explain herself for straying from the default expectation for women. When people ask me if I never wanted children and why, I feel like theyd just asked me why Ive never chosen to be an astronaut or move to Iraq. I simply never felt the urge to do so and tolerate the sacrifices. Gail Hugman from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, founder of education business Lessons Alive, always knew she didnt want her own children. Every childbearing year of my life, I would ask myself if I was sure about the decision, she says. And in fleeting moments of regret, I know in my heart it was the right one. Pronatal planning Policymakers beg to differ. Worried by demographic headwinds, a number of countries have launched pronatalist initiatives. These are often financial in nature, such as the family allowance offered by the French state to families with at least two children under 20 (the amount of which varies by income), or the tax exemption for mothers of four or more in Hungary. Polands Family 500+ programme offers parents a tax-free benefit of 500 Polish zloty (£91) per month for their second and any subsequent children. In Seoul, South Korea, pregnant women receive rewards of 700,000 won (£436) in transportation vouchers. Singapore, facing a steep decline in its birth rate, has even tried matchmaking couples in the hope of socially engineering a baby boom. Other pronatalist policies focus on childcare provision and parental leave, with the Nordic nations often praised for their generous support. In Sweden, every pre-school child is entitled to childcare from age one, the cost of which is capped. In Norway, the maximum price for kindergarten is 3,050 kroner (£255) a month. In London, by contrast, it is not unusual to pay upwards of £1,000 a month for a private nursery. Given British childcare is among the most expensive in the world, costs here inevitably affect family planning. Recent research by Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity aimed at ending pregnancy and maternity discrimination, found almost one in five women who had had an abortion cited childcare prices as the main reason. Thus far, British policies have not exactly screamed please have more children. In 2017, the Conservative government introduced a two-child limit that restricted some benefit payments to the first two children born to the poorest households. Child benefits are also tapered if the higher earning parent makes more than £50,000, and removed completely if they earn above £60,000. Given the UKs population is on course to peak at 75 million in 2063 and predicted to fall to 71 million by 2100, is it time we followed the lead of other countries in adopting a pronatal approach? The reality is that initiatives elsewhere have had a limited effect. Birth rates are still falling.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note called the results a ""major step in the right direction for the Detroit stalwart."" Chief Executive Mary Barra was more measured on a call with analysts Tuesday, describing the current operating environment as ""challenging,"" while noting a ""gradual improvement"" in supply chains, including semiconductor chips. Barra said the company ""completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June."" GM's upbeat comments were in marked contrast to Ford Motor Co's warning in mid-September that inflation-related supplier costs were running about $1 billion higher than expected and that it would have 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles in inventory lacking parts. Ford reports third-quarter results on Wednesday. GM reaffirmed its guidance for full-year net income of $9.6 billion to $11.2 billion, and full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.76. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of $2.25 topped estimates for $1.88. The automaker reported net income of $3.3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $41.9 billion, from $26.8 billion a year ago. The company said 90% of its operating profit came from North America, where it earned $3.9 billion mostly from trucks and SUVs. GM boosted prices on vehicles sold in North America by an average of $2,678 per vehicle. EBIT-adjusted net margin in North America climbed nearly a point, to 11.2%. GM has received 170,000 reservations for the new Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup, which arrives at U.S. dealers next spring. Barra said the company will ramp up EV production more slowly than anticipated, due to a ""slightly slower launch"" of battery and cell production. It now plans to build a total of 400,000 EVs in North America through early 2024, about six months later than planned. GM said it continues to negotiate supply agreements and direct investments in raw materials to help drive EV growth beyond 2025. Its majority-owned Cruise automated driving unit now expects revenue of $1 billion in 2025, said GM, which plans to begin operating a robotaxi service in three cities by the end of this year. The automaker posted a loss of $497 million on Cruise during the quarter, with a cumulative year-to-date loss of $1.4 billion."

67,"Some hints that U.S. price pressures are beginning to ease even as overall inflation remains high could encourage Federal Reserve policymakers to opt for smaller interest rate increases after they deliver a fourth straight supersized hike next week. While the Commerce Department reported on Friday that underlying inflation pressures remained stubbornly high last month, the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index showed a considerable slowdown in private-sector wage growth in the third quarter - it rose 1.2% compared to 1.6% in the second quarter - suggesting the likelihood of a scenario of ever-rising wages pushing prices higher may be receding. Fed policymakers are keenly attentive to the ECI as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation. ""Although another 75bp (basis point) rate hike lies in store next week, we suspect that slowdown (in wage growth) will help convince the Fed to slow the pace of tightening in December,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. With the U.S. central bank almost certain to lift its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range at its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, investors are now focused on what's coming in December and early 2023. Projections released last month showed policymakers' median forecast for the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 at 4.6%. Fed officials have said they expect to hit that level by early next year and several then want to pause, arguing that the economy will need time to absorb the fastest pace of tightening in 40 years and that an easing in inflation is likely to lag the rate hikes. Several policymakers in the last month have also appeared to be leaning toward a smaller rate hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate were little changed after the release of Friday's data, still pricing in a half-percentage-point hike next month and another 50 basis points over the first two meetings of next year. INFLATION STILL HIGH Whether the Fed will be able to stick to its preferred path of a pause around 4.6% remains to be seen. Certainly, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data did little to bolster central bank hopes that price pressures have decisively turned a corner. The PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure as it tracks progress in reducing inflation to its 2% target, increased 0.3% on a month-to-month basis and 6.2% on a year-to-year basis in September, matching the advances in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was up 0.5% in September, matching the gain in the prior month, and 5.1% in the 12 months through September, compared to a 4.9% year-on-year rise in August. That was enough for one analyst to argue the market is undershooting the amount of Fed tightening that remains. ""Inflation is still running way too hot, the month-on-month numbers are holding steady ... the numbers also show that the Fed is going to have to continue to raise rates and tighten probably longer than the market is pricing in currently,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors."

He also took aim at another predecessor, Boris Johnson, by saying the mandate the Conservatives were handed at the 2019 election won by the former prime minister was not the property of one individual, and he would be guided by its promises.

It is also projecting a further increase in the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas despite a 1.43% fall in the commodity on the world market. Fuel prices went up twice in the month of October 2022, as some Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) are selling petrol at ¢16.94, whilst diesel is going for ¢18.76. The Institute for Energy Security (IES) recognises the recent price increases by all OMCs monitored, and predicts that prices will see a further rise for all OMCs by end of the new pricing window on account of the significant depreciation of the cedi against the US dollar, and to some extent, the appreciable increase in gasoil price on the international fuel market. In IES estimation, gasoils [diesel] price per litre is set to break the ¢20.00 mark, with a gallon price possibly going for c90.00 on the market. gasoline [petrol] price may also inch close to Gh¢18 per litre by mid-November 2022, it stressed. Again, it said unfortunately, the 1.43% fall in the price of LPG on the world market may not translate into a reduction at the domestic pump, as it may offset cedis depreciation, and rather force the price of the commodity to rise further in the coming days. Cedi depreciates significantly Per the IES Economic Desks analysis of the foreign exchange (forex) market over the last two weeks, it said the cedi, continues to lose stability against the US dollar in significant terms. The cedi, it stated, depreciated by a whopping 32% from the previous rate of ¢10.89 to the current rate of ¢14.42, to the US dollar. Current fuel prices The IES said the current figures at the pumps suggest the national average price per litre of petrol is ¢16.94, up from ¢11.05 in the last window, representing a significant increase of 53%. The national average price per litre of diesel also jumped to ¢18.76, from ¢13.98. This represented an increase of 34%. In the pricing window under review, the IES market scan picked Petrosol, Engen, Sel, and Compass Oleum as OMCs with the highest-priced fuel on the market."

74,"Fuel prices have shot up significantly by about 10 percent even before the fortnight review of petroleum products on Sunday, October 30, 2022, by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs). This is coming despite a stable price of crude oil on the world market. Checks by Joy Business indicate some market leaders such as GOIL and TotalEnergies are selling petrol at ¢13.99 a liter while Petrosol and Engen, have increased prices for both petrol and diesel astronomically. While Petrosol is now selling petrol for ¢17.45 per liter, Engen is selling a liter of petrol for ¢17.54 . Fuel prices shoot up significantly by about 10% before next pricing window The two OMCs are also now selling a liter of diesel for ¢19. 89 pesewas and ¢19.44 pesewas respectively. Fuel prices shoot up significantly by about 10% before next pricing window Some Industry players have attributed the surge in prices to recent depreciation of the cedi against the U.S dollar. An industry analyst told Joy Business that the OMCs can no longer wait for the bi-weekly review of prices of petroleum products because the Bulk Oil Distribution Companies have been selling to them at the current market rate. Already, the Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) has indicated its intention of increasing transport fares, effective Saturday, October 29, 2022 by 19%. The increasing fuel prices will push inflation up. This will subsequently influence interest rates and the cost of borrowing. Fuel prices went up between 7% and 12% on October 16, 2022 According to the Institute for Energy Security (IES), this was due to the increases in price of the products on the international market, and the significant decline in the value of the local currency against the American greenback or US dollar."

Also, the report said geopolitical uncertainties will likely continue to impact strategies, with 81% of CEOs adjusting or planning to adjust their risk management procedures. But in spite of short-term recession fears, the increased confidence CEOs have for the longer term indicates they feel well prepared to navigate their businesses through turbulent times. In fact, when asked about their confidence in the resiliency of the global economy over the next 6 months  a period likely to be fraught with uncertainty and constant change  73% still had a positive outlook, up 13 percentage points from February 2022. Top risks looking forward The report said the Covid-19 pandemic fatigue and economic factors  including the threat of rising interest rates and inflation  top the list of most pressing concerns for CEOs today at 15% and 14%, respectively. As we look to the next three years, risks are more interconnected than ever.

GSE becomes the 11th African Stock Exchange to become a full member of the WFE. The WFE is a non-profit organisation, which has the objective to contribute to the development, support, and promotion of organised and regulated securities and derivatives markets, to meet the needs of the worlds capital markets in the best interests of their users. As a full member of the Federation, the GSE will benefit from the WFEs work done by its various Working Committees as well as from the interaction with other members to further develop the stock market in Ghana to increase its relevance and contribution to the Ghanaian financial sector eco-system and the economy at large. Membership in the association will also boost investor confidence in the Ghanaian market as we support the Government to make Ghana a gateway to Africa and a global Financial Hub. In his remarks, the Managing Director of the Ghana Stock Exchange, Ekow Afedzie said: This is another milestone chalked by the Exchange and becoming a full member of the WFE is a testament to our commitment to adhering to the highest international standards and best practices to move this Exchange from a frontier to an emerging market status. GSE looks forward to taking advantage of every opportunity available to members to develop the market"
81,"The weak performance of the Ghana cedi to the dollar impacted negatively on the Ghana Stock Exchange, as the Accra Bourse was the worst performing stock exchange on the African continent in dollar term, in the nine months of 2022. It recorded -39% return for investors in dollar term as of September 30, 2022. However, in cedi term, it registered -11.80% return for investors. This performance is far from last years achievement where it was the second best performing stock market in Africa. In dollar term, the GSE placed 15th out of 15 top stock exchanges in Africa. In cedi term, its position was 11th. The capital market has so far this year not been left out of the challenging economic environment. It was hit severely by the rapid depreciation of the cedi and the rising inflation in the first-half of this year, and the situation continues unabated. For the Financial Stock Index, the market has recorded -3.80% for investors, so far in 2022. Also, total market capitalization at the end of September 2022 stood at ¢63.9 billion, compared with ¢64.49 billion in December 31, 2022. Meanwhile, 15 stocks had lost value since January 1, 2022, compared with seven gainers. SIC Insurance is the biggest gainer, recording a 312% gain in value since January 2022. It is presently selling at 33 pesewas per share. Access Bank follows closely, registering 27.30% gain in value, selling at ¢4.10 per share. Meanwhile, licensed buying cocoa firm, PBC, was the biggest loser shedding 33% in value. It is selling at 2 pesewas per share. GSE records -24.1% return in dollar term for investors in first-half of 2022 The GSE ended the first-half of of 2022 with a negative year-to-date return of 24.13% in dollar term.

82,"The Bank of Ghana has assured it will not allow the black market to drive the exchange rate market in the country. According to the Governor, Dr. Ernest Addison, it will do everything possible within its remit to ensure that black market dealers do not dictate to the market. He added that his outfit has also created a Twitter page, purposely to give updates on the daily exchange rate. I think we should try to understand what is going on in the foreign exchange market. We have decided to introduce a Twitter page with the daily exchange rate that will be released every morning by the Bank of Ghana. Because we do not want the black market to be driving exchange rates in this country. And, we are hoping that this alone will help clear a lot of noise on the exchange forum. There have been all kinds of rumours about some conversions and foreign exchange balances into cedis. Definitely, nobody has even thought of any such measure, so we need to deal with such rumours with contempt because we are not looking at that sort of intervention at all. The Governor further said that as we are all aware, we got the $750 million from the AfriExim Bank and I think today [October 26, 2022], we are supposed to receive the $790 million from the COCOBOD syndicated loan so the Central Bank has some liquidity. Enough liquidity available till IMF programme takes off He also stressed that the Central Bank has enough liquidity to keep things relatively stable till the International Monetary Fund Programme kicks in and the financing assurances expected from other partners come in. I am aware of the recent developments in terms of liquidity in the banking sector. As I said, I took note of the advice from Washington on the financial stability issue that there has to be targeted liquidity support to preserve financial stability without undermining the inflation control objectives. So this is really the context we should have the discussion on all the complaints of we need liquidity and BoG not supplying liquidity. Yesterday I met the CEOs and I have assured them that we will provide the necessary liquidity to ensure that we dont have a system of a liquidity problem. But we do that within the context of keeping inflation low."
84,"Putin badly miscalculated. The Russian army terribly underperformed. Kyiv has shown unexpected resilience in the face of what experts thought was far superior Russian firepower. This, were told, is the story of Russias invasion of Ukraine, and all of it is true. Vladimir Putins talk of a dirty bomb is evidence of how badly the war is going for him. Russia has been taught a bitter lesson, one that other trigger-happy, self-proclaimed great powers would be wise to heed. But one part has been missed. For all of Russias difficulties, it is in a far better shape than Ukraine. Fighting has left Ukraine in ruin. Consider these eye-watering statistics: at least seven million people, mostly women and children, have left the country, from a pre-war population of 37 million, excluding Crimea and some of the Donbas. Some probably hope to return, but many never will. Tens of thousands, at a conservative estimate, have been killed in the fighting. Most of them civilians. There is no understating the demographic blow on Ukraine, which, even in better times, faced declining birth rates and increasing outward migration. It will take them decades to recover from this loss, if it ever does. Ukraines economy has been battered, too. Whole cities have been levelled to the ground. Mariupol once housed a giant steel complex, Azov steel works, Ukraines third largest producer of steel, but the plant has been destroyed. Ukraines largest oil refinery, in Kremenchug, was targeted by Russian missile strikes in April, and remains shut. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, which once provided 20 per cent of Ukrainian electricity, has been shut down, and might well be destroyed as the war continues. The country is also being cut off from the outside world. Ukraines air connection has been severed and access by sea is limited. That it took a high-level diplomatic intervention from Turkey to restart the export of agricultural products shows how precarious Ukraines position is. The World Bank thinks that Ukraines economy will have shrunk by 45 per cent this year. That might be optimistic. Any discussion of Ukraines reconstruction is wishful thinking. While the war continues, its not feasible for the government to rebuild the country. Private investors will stay away too. You cant have economic development in a war zone, never mind one that may become a nuclear battleground. Even if an apocalyptic scenario were averted, Russia could well continue crippling Ukraines economy with random missile strikes against critical infrastructure. Already Ukraines cities face electricity shortages with daily blackouts, a part of Russias morale-sapping campaign. There will be no return to normality while this nightmare continues. Ukrainians face a bleak, hard winter, and a very uncertain future. Ukraine had no choice but to defend itself. Capitulation and annexation were not palatable alternatives. Books will be written about how this war came about, whether Russias invasion was inevitable, or whether something could have been done to avert it. But given what we know today of the terrible, tragic consequences of this war, would all those involved have pursued similar policies, or would they have sought a compromise? Putin is responsible for Ukraines dire situation, but it is naive and ahistorical to imagine that Kyiv consistently pursued sensible policies, given its unenviable proximity to a dangerous, unpredictable neighbour. This need not be considered victim-blaming. Someone living in a forest next to a bears den would rightly find the prospect of being mauled completely unacceptable, and they would be within their rights to fight back against an attack. Negotiating with a bear is, after all, usually a futile exercise and, indeed, bears dont understand off-ramps. But, nevertheless, shouldnt we be careful around wild animals? Ukraines is a tragic lot. The country's pro-western orientation rattled Putin but the absence of western security guarantees gave him an opening. Ukraine became stuck between a resurgent, militant, imperialistic Russia, and an indignant West, willing to help Ukraine, but unwilling to fight for it. If there is a lesson in this sad situation, it is that countries in the grey, contested space between great powers should tread with caution. Aggressive neighbours dont have special rights or privileges, but they are capable of inflicting grim damage on their would-be victims, and so must be treated with some (at least superficial) deference. Treading carefully does not necessarily mean appeasement. There is a vast space between brave defiance and grovelling acceptance. Exploring that space is what makes for good policy. With Ukraine in ruins and reconstruction a distant dream, we should remember that heroics are needed when political foresight fails."
85,"It is the moment nobody was quite sure would actually ever happen: after months of drama, Elon Musk says his $44bn (£38bn) deal to buy Twitter is complete. He announced the big news on Twitter itself, of course, he has changed his bio to read Chief Twit and declared the bird is freed. Job done, as far as he is concerned. There has been no official confirmation as yet, and the silence from Twitter HQ so far has been rather deafening. But perhaps there is nobody there to send that email  Mr Musk has reportedly already fired chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde, while chairman Bret Taylors LinkedIn profile suggests he is no longer at the firm either. So what might Mr Musks Twitter look like? A digital town square Mr Musk addressed potential advertisers in an uncharacteristically humble message posted on the site on Thursday. In it, he spoke of buying Twitter because he wanted to try to help humanity, and said he wanted civilisation to have a digital town square. He also accepted that his mission may fail. The fact that he wrote specifically to those who advertise on Twitter suggests he intends for now at least to stick with its digital advertising business model. That is despite this revenue starting to fall for giants like Google-owner Alphabet and Facebook-owner Meta, as the global financial crisis bites and firms find themselves with less cash to splash on marketing In the past he has spoken bombastically about wanting to lighten moderation, so that more voices can be heard more freely (Twitter has long been accused of favouring left-leaning, liberal messages, which it denies). Might he decide to bring back some of the more controversial tweeters, banned under the previous administration  former US president Donald Trump (who has previously said he had no desire to return), or more recently, his friend Kanye West? I am not so sure. Mr Musk now offers a more curtailed vision, saying that the platform must remain welcoming, must abide by national laws and must not become a free-for-all hellscape. West was banned for anti-Semitism and Mr Trump permanently suspended for inciting violence  sounds a bit hellscapey to me. What next for Twitter under Elon Musk? Spam and super app hints Mr Musk has raged against the amount of spam and bot accounts he believes litter the site  Twitter has always disputed his claims that its official figure is far too low. He could order a mass cull, although that would probably affect everybodys all-important follower numbers, which could be an unpopular first move. Perhaps his most intriguing hint so far is about his new company being the start of X, the everything app. He has never elaborated on that but many have suggested that he is referring to the creation of a kind of super app along the lines of Chinas WeChat  a one-stop-shop for social media, messaging, finance, food orders  in a nutshell, everyday life admin. The West does not yet have such a thing, although one could argue that Metas WhatsApp and even Facebook Messenger are quietly morphing into services with multiple functions. Mr Musk has not disguised his love of cryptocurrency and Binance, the worlds largest crypto-exchange, is a proud investor in his vision (according to the press release I received just after 05:00 BST). Could we see a Twitter set-up for businesses to accept payments  in crypto? That would be a hit with crypto fans and a horror for those who warn that crypto remains a risky choice, unregulated and therefore unprotected if anything goes wrong. What we do know about Mr Musk is that he is visionary, volatile, ambitious, and creative. We can guarantee the changes will start rolling in  and already some Twitter fans are saying the change of leadership will drive them away. We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters, said the investor Peter Thiel of the tech industry, long before the meme expectations vs reality became a thing. With Mr Musk, we may well get both."

92,"The Ministry of Finance has dismissed allegations that negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are not going well because the Fund does not see any seriousness on the part of the government. Again, the Ministry refutes the claims that the government does not have a programme for consideration by the IMF, whilst officials of the Fund have discovered inaccuracies in the macroeconomic figures presented by the governments Economic Management Team. None but accurate figures have been presented to the IMF; and the Ministry has been fully transparent at all times. The Ghanaian negotiation team remains credible and highly respected, and has enjoyed great cooperation from the IMF. To suggest otherwise is false, misleading and pure mischief which must be ignored, it said in a statement. To the contrary, it explained that the government has submitted its Post-COVID Programme for Economic Growth to the Fund, which the programme has formed the basis of negotiations, adding, We refer the public to the IMFs Press Statement dated 20th October, 2022: The Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement. The allegation that the negotiations are not going well is categorically untrue. The IMF itself has on numerous occasions stated unequivocally that negotiations are progressing well, and affirmed that both parties are fully committed to reaching a deal as soon as feasible. We quote the Fund below. We had constructive discussions on policies aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability  Staff express their gratitude to the authorities, and other stakeholders in Ghana for their constructive engagement and support during this mission. Furthermore, it said the Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement. We made good progress in identifying specific policies that would restore macroeconomic stability.  The IMF team and the Ghanaian authorities remain fully committed to reaching agreement on a framework and policies for an IMF-supported program as soon as feasible, it added. The Finance Ministry also expressed disappointment that at a time when the Republic is engaged in serious efforts aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, the propagation of falsehoods and misrepresentations, supported by the publication of same, appear to be gaining notoriety. Most regrettably, it said such unfounded and misleading statements undermine national efforts when introduced into public discourse. We caution that such falsehoods contribute to the erosion of stability in the Ghanaian economy, and could unduly hold back the strong progress of negotiations so far. The Ministry hereby calls on all to be responsible in utterances related to the IMF negotiations.

94,"Why do we do this to ourselves sometimes? Taking advantage of situations to cheat others to make money? That is the situation we find ourselves in at this critical juncture of economic hardships with prices of goods and services skyrocketing, sometimes on daily basis. Admitted. The drop in the value of our cedi as against the US dollar is a reality hitting all of us so hard. One cannot deny the fact that the unsurpassed inflation rate is having a huge toll on the prices of goods, food items and services. Exploitation However, one can say that the daily price increases by some sellers are sheer exploitation of the situation to make money. Unfortunately, those deep in that game do not feel ashamed of what they are doing. They see it as a season to reap what they have not sown. I had bought five bags of a brand of cement last week Tuesday morning at a price of around ¢60 plus per bag. Then on the following day, Wednesday morning, barely 24 hours, I went back to get two more bags at the same place. It was clearly obvious that their stocks from the previous day had not moved much. I was completely dazed then, that the same lady I met the day before, told me the price of all the cement brands had gone up by as much as ¢10 per bag. I stood there in shock. I asked her what had changed for the price increase when she herself received payment from me in the region of ¢60 just 24 hours earlier. She looked at me and retorted: That is the message they have sent us this morning. Really? Who would instruct that old stocks should change price and sell with as much as ¢10 increment within a day? What would the price be by the end of the week then? I actually could not walk away as I would normally have done whenever I smelled cheating in the air when buying. This time around, I had no choice but to buy. I could also not argue much because my mason was waiting to finish the work for me. Then, just two days ago, I stopped by a drinks seller to get some packs of assorted drinks for the house. Like I sometimes do, I sat in my car and did the transaction with the seller. I first asked for the prices of two of my favourite drinks as that is the normal thing to do these days. One has to ask before one buys. The lady I asked the price from looking at a second lady sitting close to her and whispered something in her ears. They whispered something to each other and called out a price that seemed outrageous to me. I asked politely if that was the latest price and they both said, yes. At that point, I saw cheating sparkling in their eyes and drove off. Luckily, ahead of me was another drinks seller so I stopped to enquire about prices as she seemed to have the varieties I was looking for. The seller was quite genuine. The prices she gave me for the same drinks I stopped for earlier were more like it. They were reasonable and so paid for my selection and drove off. Kalabule Does anyone remember the early days of COVID-19 when we were locked down? Similar advantage-taking exercises by sellers were abhorrently applied, especially at the open markets where prices of foodstuffs like gari, rice, beans and some fruits shot up in price. People were just taking advantage of the situation happening then. So what really is going on currently? Are some sellers taking advantage of the system while indulging in their own pricing of goods? If only people who are exploiting the economic situation could cast their minds back to those days of Kalabule and what happened as a result. In case they are not old enough and therefore never experienced or got to understand the situation at the time with Kalabule, what is happening now can easily be classified as such. It was a time when some individuals in the retail trade took advantage of the harsh economic situation then, bought goods and hoarded them and released them at their own bidding and at a higher price just to exploit others. No one would wish for those days to come back and so the sellers who are dictating their own pricing even on older stocks and on daily basis, to make the situation look too dire should put a stop to it. Just as the days of Kalabule went under, the current situation will also go under and hopefully, we shall return to fairness and justice in the retail market. They would be the losers."

As an individual who advocated in March 2021 for Ghana to even go for a 2-year debt service suspension as part of a package to change the country over 24 months, I feel angry that government ignored this initiative that could, together with other measures, have saved the economy and the free-falling cedi. So, why did government not take advantage of the DSSI? Two basic reasons We may never get official reasons for governments reckless decision to not apply for the DSSI or approach the IMF earlier than it did. But, as a political and economic analyst, I have two basic reasons to explain why we are where we are: Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Government did not want to be exposed to be in a situation of debt unsustainability and would have had to institute policies aimed at debt sustainability, denying them of the reckless borrowing and spending that they had become accustomed to. Applying for the DSSI would have forced government to undertake a DSA that would include the financial sector clean-up costs and the energy sector legacy debts to government debts, and thereby show overall government debt level as unsustainable. With that, government would have been compelled to implement policies/measures to bring our debt to sustainable levels over a period, something this government was not willing to implement, given their addiction to Eurobonds. Sadly, they are going to do the very DSA and implement the very policies they didnt want to do to save the economy and the Cedi, now doing so under circumstances of a failing economy and a free-falling Cedi. They could have done it when they had control of the situation. Arrogance Having ridiculed President Mahama and his government for going to the IMF in 2015, this government did not want to have anything to do with the IMF and the World Bank. Ken Ofori-Atta, even when the signs were on the wall that going to the IMF was inevitable, was saying that Ghana was a proud country that would not go to the IMF. The pride and arrogance of government made them not apply for the DSSI, when it was clear Ghana was going to suffer big time for not doing so."
96,"Hand washing is the single most effective way to reduce the spread of infections and contamination. Although common knowledge, it has taken a global pandemic to reinforce a practice as simple as washing ones hands with soap under running water, to curb the spread of a deadly disease. Today as the world moves on and adjusts to life with a virus that has seemingly become part of us, it is more so pivotal to ingrain the message and practice of hand hygiene into all. Together, we must ensure that healthy handwashing habits are built to mitigate the risks and effects of the spread of pathogens. It is for this reason that every year on October 15, Global Handwashing Day is celebrated as a day dedicated to advocating for handwashing with soap as an easy, effective, and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives. This year the theme for the day is Unite for Universal Hand Hygiene. A global call to action, regardless of role, age, gender, religion, race, or political affiliation to address the matter of hand hygiene with the urgency it requires. We may remember that when COVID-19 emerged some two years ago, one of the most critical activities used for preventing infection was hand washing. A practice with benefits that have been known to curb the spread of infectious diseases since its discovery by Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847. Relating to benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed that handwashing with soap could protect about 1 out of every 3 young children who get sick with diarrhea and almost 1 out of 5 young children with respiratory infections like pneumonia. Similarly, due to its immense socio-economic benefits, one of the targets under the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, is for the global community to achieve access to hygiene for all by 2030. According to UNICEF, approximately half a million people die each year from diarrhea or acute respiratory infections, causing significant financial costs resulting from sickness and death that could be avoided with proper hygiene, precisely hand hygiene. Essentially, hand hygiene is one of the most important elements of overall hygiene, begging the question of why there is limited access to the basic act of cleaning hands when it can save lives and reduce illness which is essential to the socio-economic well-being of a country. Therein lies a unique opportunity to position hand hygiene as an important long-term safety and public policy issue and increase as well as hasten investments on facilities for good hand hygiene. The UN states that hygiene targets by 2030 requires an increase in the pace of progress, otherwise at current rates by the year 2030, 1.9 billion people will lack basic hand hygiene facilities. In effect, nations should tackle the issue of hand hygiene wholistically  inclusive of both the private and public sectors. Not as a temporary public health intervention when crisis looms but as an everyday practice that contributes to health and economic resilience. The government as the leader should be responsible for public policies backed with regulation and enforcement of the availability of water and hand washing facilities in public spaces such as hospitals and schools. In addition, investments should be made in education, sensitization, and capacity building. The citizenry, inclusive of households and individuals should adapt and maintain the best practices of hand hygiene and hold themselves accountable to standards that have been set to accelerate the progress of the policy and practice of basic hand hygiene. Unite for Universal Hand Hygiene: A policy and practice for all The author, Nana Adwoa Twumwaa Baafi The private sector must not be left out as they have the capacity to work closely with authorities to make key investments that will provide accessible and affordable facilities for all. From the media, civil society, community and thought leaders, the private sector, the old and the young, there is a part to be played by all as we push for policies and initiatives that can be a pathway towards creating communities that have the resources to practice hand hygiene and do so habitually."
97,"Let me preface this piece by saying that I am nothing but a humble consumer privileged to find myself in this epic battle for survival called Life in Accra  a tale that will inspire generations to come. Each morning, the sun rises unfailingly with its rays  a prompt to get up, gear up and stand at the ready for a battle. Government will fights us, MPs will misrepresent us, the dollar will hammers us down even further, our education will fail us, and fake preachers will defraud us. At night, we retire to bed hoping against hope that tomorrow will be better. But does it ever? Today, it is the increase in the price of pure (sachet) water. What is it going to be tomorrow? I dont know. Somehow, we will survive today to see it. Before I plunge into my diatribe, I first need to acknowledge the current price hikes in this country, without which this article would not be possible. Second, Id like to thank everything that is wrong with this country for teaching us ways to survive pre-pandemic, in-pandemic, and post-pandemic. If you live in Ghana and have no natural or nurtured survival instincts wired into your DNA, you must not have lived here for very long. Now to it. Yesterday, NASPAWAP (National Association of Sachet and Packaged Water Producers) announced new prices for pure water. An unexpected announcement, but lacking the surprise element. Per their release, starting Monday, October 31 a sachet of pure water will be sold at 60 pesewas. This new increase triggered a thought Ive mused on for years now, that pure water retailers that sell by the sachet make nearly 100 percent profit on their business. Prior to the increase, a bag sold for GHS 7. Going by the original price of the bag of 30 sachets, my basic math teaches me that a single unit should go for about 25 pesewas (rounded up to the nearest whole number). Lets add a generous 50 percent profit margin to account for refrigeration and labour costs i.e hawking. That should bring us to approximately 40 p. However, they were sold on our streets for 50 p  double its worth! It means that the retailer resells a bag for a total of GHS 15 (0.5 x 30 = 15)! 50 pesewas may not seem like much, but if you consider that that is over 100% profit margin from the original cost, it is mind blowing. I dont know much about business, but that seems like an overly generous deal. With the latest increase in retail prices of 60p, a bag sold for GHS10 will gain a whopping 80 percent profit. My question is, why? How reasonable is it to have a business that makes 80% profit in this current state of economic crisis? Theres nothing pure about that if you ask me. It begs even more questions: Which governing body is in charge of the Consumer Price Index in Ghana? Is there even one? Why do we insist on making things even more difficult for each other as a people? There are many reasons why Ghana doesnt work like its supposed to, and its about time we took an inward look into our psyche as a people; questioned our motives, and try to define who we want to be. Are we going to continue using Kwaku Ananse tactics on each other (a topic for another day) or are we going to be like the son, Ntikuma, and make better altruistic choices? Lets also consider the fact that street hawking is illegal in Ghana and the majority of these hawkers dont have valid business registrations that can be taxed. Some might consider this piece an attack on street hawkers. Well, it is not so much that as it is the mind with which we run petty trading in the country. For years now, weve been aware of how over-priced street items are but in the moment of need, we either strike a bargain and buy or ignore and drive off. But when you really think about it, nobody should have to survive on pure water sales on the street for survival. For me, its one of the most difficult ways to earn a living: standing in the middle of traffic in the sweltering heat, chasing after cars for coins at the risk of your life, and making less than a dollar a day in profit. Its outrageous! And nobody can fault them for trying to make an honest buck, high-profit margins aside. That said, they should not translate their frustration to the consumer who is suffering the same or even worse fate that they are. It seems to me that the mentality of nearly every soul, especially in the capital, is to find the sleaziest way to make money; street hawking being the perfect, most glaring reflection of that mindset. Think of how we have come to accept that prices in Osu, even those outside the posh buildings, are at least 3 times what they are supposed to be. Why? Because it is assumed that the majority of people who trek through Oxford Street have deep pockets. Who is to blame? You tell me. We can look everywhere for cause, but when the gavel falls, it should strike hard on the pate of leadership and hopefully knock them out. Not only political leaders, mind you, but industry leaders as well. Because how can they possibly, with a straight face, defend whats been going on for decades now? A nation muddled in layers of endemic and systemic dealings piled on through years of fraud and forgery in collusion with a desperate populace who see no hope in sight. We are without a doubt at a tipping point and a new movement must be engaged. A movement not in demonstrations  we know how those go  social media rants or war chants, but a movement of the mind. A movement of young people determined not to be corrupt; determined to help each other build up; determined to start a whole new generation that has learned from the mistakes of the forbearers and is poised towards honesty at the very minimum. Our failed attempts at being instant millionaires keep us from growing together. Everyone is willing to make the quickest buck using the most acceptable dubious means, and we allow it because secretly, we admire it. Young people are staking sports bets with their tuition fees or their mothers daily sales; pastors are doing same with church offering. The list goes on. When will it stop? We give people like Agradaa aka Evangelist Patricia Oduro power through our greed to scam thousands of victims when most people are still reeling from the shock of the MenzGold saga? There must be something in the air. Something that tells us its okay to take advantage of the next person so long as our needs are met. Theres something in our culture that makes it okay and it is not okay. Past governments and present ones have failed us but lets not fail ourselves. There is a better time to make a quick profit; when the times are better. Now isnt it. This is the time to survive. But if your survival means the death or deliberate deprivation of another, perhaps, and I say this with the greatest of reservations, we deserve whats happening to us."
98,"In the news, former NPP MP and anticorruption crusader, PC Appiah Ofori urges a vote of no confidence in the President rather than the focus on Ken Ofori Atta. It will appear the public has already cast that vote if parliament wont. The President has been booed and angered to curse and tell people, literally, that he didnt force them to vote for him. 80 NPP MPs (59% of the Majority Caucus) boldly broke ranks to publicly tell the President to sack the finance minister and deputy Charles Adu-Boahen or they will not support any business he brings to the hung parliament. There is also a motion of censure that all NDC MPs must vote for to compel the President to sack Ken. Any NDC MP who disobeys the 3-line whip is doomed. NPPs Kwame Pianim, the renowned economist, says IMF negotiations are not going well. He insists Ken must leave before he destroys Ghana. #FixTheCountry, rights activist Martin Kpebu are mobilizing citizens for a #KumePreko reloaded demonstration to demand the Presidents resignation on 5th November. OccupyGhana demands a Lean and Mean Government. The CitzensCoalition of CSOs held a #NanaAddoMustListen press conference on Thursday. President Mahama says the opposition NDC prefers to offer solutions and not gloat over the crisis he and some experts insist is largely due to incompetence of the Akufo Addo Government. President Akufo Addo who was touring the country and touting his good works last week but getting booed by people the Okyenhene describes as villagers, witches and wizards, had cause to encourage the army to remain loyal to the democratic project. He will be speaking to the nation tomorrow after a 3-day emergency retreat meeting with his cabinet, bankers, forex traders, market women and various industry players. It does appear the rising tensions have whipped him into reality check to abandon those expensive campaign trips to focus on what urgent actions are needed in these trying times. But will his address on Sunday get to turn things around the way John Mahamas gave an instant boost to the gari and beans  gobe industry on Friday? The celebrated leader of Singapore. I prefer to join those who hardly refer to him as former prime minister but a leader, a true leader, and for good reason. Lee Kuan Yew posits that [w]hen you reach your limit, there are two ways out of that box that you are in. One is to reach new resources by either capturing territory or trading. To capture territory, you have to use force and you must win or you are captured. This is our present circumstance; we must win or be reduced to subhuman. What he refers to as force, I say includes new revolutionary ideas extraordinarily required for a not-ordinary situation set to inflict havoc on Ghana. LKY rallied his people around his vision for a country without natural resources. When he sought help, he was told to consider production of fish hooks. He said all his country had was its human resource. If a thing works, lets work it he declared. Thats how he moved his country from third world to a first world economy. Quoting the Bible and shouting this too shall pass, solves nothing, Mr. President. These extraordinary times require extraordinary solutions led by a demonstration of extraordinary leadership. Ghanaians look forward to your address that you will demonstrate you are an authentic leader and not one specialized in empty sloganeering, and getting angry when the people give feedback about your government taking them downhill. Thats My Take."
99,"Why do we do this to ourselves sometimes? Taking advantage of situations to cheat others to make money? That is the situation we find ourselves in at this critical juncture of economic hardships with prices of goods and services skyrocketing, sometimes on daily basis. Admitted. The drop in the value of our cedi as against the US dollar is a reality hitting all of us so hard. One cannot deny the fact that the unsurpassed inflation rate is having a huge toll on the prices of goods, food items and services. Exploitation However, one can say that the daily price increases by some sellers are sheer exploitation of the situation to make money. Unfortunately, those deep in that game do not feel ashamed of what they are doing. They see it as a season to reap what they have not sown. I had bought five bags of a brand of cement last week Tuesday morning at a price of around ¢60 plus per bag. Then on the following day, Wednesday morning, barely 24 hours, I went back to get two more bags at the same place. It was clearly obvious that their stocks from the previous day had not moved much. I was completely dazed then, that the same lady I met the day before, told me the price of all the cement brands had gone up by as much as ¢10 per bag. I stood there in shock. I asked her what had changed for the price increase when she herself received payment from me in the region of ¢60 just 24 hours earlier. She looked at me and retorted: That is the message they have sent us this morning. Really? Who would instruct that old stocks should change price and sell with as much as ¢10 increment within a day? What would the price be by the end of the week then? I actually could not walk away as I would normally have done whenever I smelled cheating in the air when buying. This time around, I had no choice but to buy. I could also not argue much because my mason was waiting to finish the work for me. Then, just two days ago, I stopped by a drinks seller to get some packs of assorted drinks for the house. Like I sometimes do, I sat in my car and did the transaction with the seller. I first asked for the prices of two of my favourite drinks as that is the normal thing to do these days. One has to ask before one buys. The lady I asked the price from looking at a second lady sitting close to her and whispered something in her ears. They whispered something to each other and called out a price that seemed outrageous to me. I asked politely if that was the latest price and they both said, yes. At that point, I saw cheating sparkling in their eyes and drove off. Luckily, ahead of me was another drinks seller so I stopped to enquire about prices as she seemed to have the varieties I was looking for. The seller was quite genuine. The prices she gave me for the same drinks I stopped for earlier were more like it. They were reasonable and so paid for my selection and drove off. Kalabule Does anyone remember the early days of COVID-19 when we were locked down? Similar advantage-taking exercises by sellers were abhorrently applied, especially at the open markets where prices of foodstuffs like gari, rice, beans and some fruits shot up in price. People were just taking advantage of the situation happening then. So what really is going on currently? Are some sellers taking advantage of the system while indulging in their own pricing of goods? If only people who are exploiting the economic situation could cast their minds back to those days of Kalabule and what happened as a result. In case they are not old enough and therefore never experienced or got to understand the situation at the time with Kalabule, what is happening now can easily be classified as such. It was a time when some individuals in the retail trade took advantage of the harsh economic situation then, bought goods and hoarded them and released them at their own bidding and at a higher price just to exploit others. No one would wish for those days to come back and so the sellers who are dictating their own pricing even on older stocks and on daily basis, to make the situation look too dire should put a stop to it. Just as the days of Kalabule went under, the current situation will also go under and hopefully, we shall return to fairness and justice in the retail market. They would be the losers."
100,"Pending home sales fell for the fourth straight month in September, as mortgage rates topped 7% and the cost of buying a house soared, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. The groups pending home sales index tumbled 10.2% from August, leaving sales 31% below where they were a year ago. The number was worse than expected. ""Persistent inflation has proven quite harmful to the housing market,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. ""The Federal Reserve has had to drastically raise interest rates to quell inflation, which has resulted in far fewer buyers and even fewer sellers."" It is further evidence, along with a slowdown in new residential construction, that the heady days of the housing sector seen in 2021 and early 2022 are over. For buyers of a median-priced home who use a 20% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment has shot up a shocking $1,000 higher than last year, George Ratiu, senior economist and manager of economic research at Realtor.com said. With wages falling behind on account of inflation, and rates rising, buyers purchasing power has been reduced by over $100,000. There is also an effect on existing homeowners, who may be looking to sell as prices come off their highs of earlier this year. The number of new listings on the market is also down considerably, as existing homeowners sit tight with sub-3% mortgage rates, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. The combination of sagging demand and limited inventory means that home sales activity will continue to drop off during the last quarter of the year. Overall, total home sales for 2022 will be down significantly from last year, likely hitting a level not seen since 2014. The rise in rates and drop in sales activity is a direct result of the Federal Reserves tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. The Fed is seeking to cool down the economy even if that results in higher unemployment and even a recession. The economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the third quarter, reversing direction after two previous quarters showed a contraction in the nations gross domestic output. Earlier Thursday, the governments personal consumption expenditures price index showed that spending increased 0.6% in September as Americans dipped into their savings and credit cards to continue consuming even as inflation held steady during the month. ""Todays report showed some positive signs: the topline PCE inflation number slowed, and incomes and consumer spending came in slightly above expectations, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at data analytics firm Morning Consult. However, there are still reasons to worry. Core PCE inflation continued to rise, confirming consumers are still contending with elevated prices. Morning Consults proprietary monthly inflation data from mid-October hints that inflation may be slowing, but consumer spending will likely remain under pressure until meaningful price relief kicks in, Bruun added. Also Friday, the University of Michigans consumer sentiment survey for October remained largely unchanged and reflected a mixed bag of improving supply chain issues and worries over inflation and uncertainty over the economys future course. This month, buying conditions for durables surged 23% on the basis of easing prices and supply constraints, said Joanne Hsu, survey director. However, year-ahead expected business conditions worsened 19%. These divergent patterns reflect substantial uncertainty over inflation, policy responses, and developments worldwide, and consumer views are consistent with a recession ahead in the economy."

103,"The Federal Reserves favored measure of inflation remained unchanged in September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Friday. However, the core index, leaving out often volatile food and energy costs, rose to a 5.1% annual rate from Augusts 4.9% level. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell often points to the core PCE as a barometer of inflation when discussing monetary policy. Personal spending rose 0.6% in September, showing consumers still have some firepower left. Rate hikes? What rate hikes? Personal Income & Outlays show Americans increase spending and made more money in September at a pace above estimates, Navy Federal Credit Union Corporate Economist Robert Frick tweeted. The report is the last government reading on inflation before the Fed meets on Tuesday to consider monetary policy. Most analysts expect that two-day meeting will conclude with the central bank raising rates by 75 basis points as it continues its campaign against inflation. On Thursday, the government reported that gross domestic product increased by 2.6% annually in the third quarter, though there were signs of a slowdown. The housing sector has been hit by high mortgage rates and there are weaknesses in retail and the tech industry. Amazon on Thursday forecast weak fourth quarter sales, suggesting the upcoming holiday season would not be as robust as some retailers had hoped. The key to our outlook is what path inflation will take, says Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial. If the Fed raises rates and slows down the economy, then inflation will come down. The question, though, is at what cost. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the regime of higher interest rates will bring pain to business and consumers alike, and that could take the form of increased unemployment and a recession. Already, Powell is feeling political heat from Democrats worried about the effect on higher interest rates as they also try to deflect blame for inflation that is running at an 8.2% annual rate. Raising rates now when prices may come down would be foolish and damaging to American consumers and small businesses, Colorado Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper wrote in a letter to Powell Thursday, adding that the Feds actions so far have failed to knock inflation down. There have been meaningful declines in prices in some areas of the economy. Housing prices are now rising at a 13% annual rate compared to 20% at their peak earlier this year. Gasoline prices have fallen more than $1 a gallon from their $5 peak this summer. But what concerns economists and the Fed is that inflation has spread from the goods sector to the services part of the economy and the labor market remains tight, putting pressure on employers to increase wages. Dan Wantrobski, technical director at Janney Montgomery Scott, says that the economy has largely shed the main effects of the coronavirus, with supply chain disruptions easing and businesses operating closer to normal. The U.S. economy is running hot, he says. I think it is going to continue hot. Beyond the amount that the Fed hikes rates next week, observers will be looking for what Powell says in his press conference about the economy and future monetary policy. Markets are hoping for signs the Fed could be poised for a halt, or reduction, in the amount of interest rate increases as it assesses what effect its aggressive tightening has had on the economy."
104,"The U.S economy has proven itself resilient throughout the coronavirus pandemic, recovering from the sharpest quarterly contraction in history, but earlier this year it looked to some as if it had finally succumbed. Two quarterly contractions in gross domestic product in the first half of the year led many seasoned observers (and more than a few politicians) to say a recession had begun. But hold the sympathy cards. On Thursday, the government is expected to report the economy expanded in the third quarter, perhaps by as much as 3%. Thats a performance that would be considered good in any economic environment. A widely followed model of economic output from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta known as GDP Now pegs the third quarter growth number at 2.9%, up from 2.4% just a month ago. Ahead of Thursdays preliminary Q3 US GDP release, these comments are broadly consistent with the latest GDPNow forecasts which suggest a return to positive GDP growth in Q3, BCA Research wrote on Monday morning. Nevertheless, the inflationary backdrop and tight labor market conditions continue to warrant tighter monetary policy  posing a threat to the economic outlook. In its release last week of the minutes from the September meeting of its monetary policy committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues described the economys performance as expanding modestly with a strong uptick in travel and tourism along with steady or growing activity in manufacturing among the positives. But it noted weakness in retail, auto sales and housing from the central banks aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes. Still, recent earnings reports from the big banks and other barometers of consumer spending show that Americans continue to spend, even as inflation tops 8% annually and their consumption habits shift from goods to services. Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with strong, although slower growing, spending levels and still maintained elevated deposit amounts, CEO Brian Moynihan said in announcing the banks better-than-expected third-quarter earnings last week. Across the bank, we grew loans by 12% over the last year as we delivered the financial resources to support our clients. The stock market, often a predictor of future economic health, posted its best week since June last week, ending on Friday with a 700-plus point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow was up nearly 5% for the week. No, the economy doesnt want to die, says Sevin Yeltekin, dean of the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester. Theres a lot of resilience in a lot of places. Yet most economists are still predicting a recession within the next 12 months, although the odds of one beginning before next year appear to be receding somewhat. And some have taken heart from a suggestion late last week in The Wall Street Journal that the Fed may take a breather after its November meeting, when another 75 basis point hike in interest rates is expected. Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, added credence to that idea on Friday during a speech at the University of California-Berkeley. I think the time is now to start talking about stepping down  the time is now to start planning for stepping down, Daly said. The Fed is raising from rock bottom levels, says Nela Richardson, chief economist at private payroll and human resources firm ADP. It works with a lag. They have to hike to a higher level and then stay there. I would argue they are going to stay there for months, maybe a year. Factoring into that decision will be a report out Friday morning. The personal consumption expenditures price index is followed closely by the Fed, especially its core index that strips out food and energy costs to show how broad inflation is throughout the economy. Expectations are for it to have declined on a monthly basis in September to 0.5% from 0.6% in August. Other economic news this week will include housing prices on Tuesday and new home sales on Wednesday. The housing sector is in a slump as mortgage rates have doubled from a year ago. The week ends with the final University of Michigan consumer sentiment report for September. While readings of the consumer psyche have shown a gloomy outlook, Americans have continued to spend, bolstered by household balance sheets that are still in good shape despite the highest inflation in 40 years. The idea of shopping is ingrained, says Kathy Gramling, consumer industry markets leader at EY Americas. We can always count on the American consumer to consume."

Thats a performance that would be considered good in any economic environment. A widely followed model of economic output from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta known as GDP Now pegs the third quarter growth number at 2.9%, up from 2.4% just a month ago. Ahead of Thursdays preliminary Q3 US GDP release, these comments are broadly consistent with the latest GDPNow forecasts which suggest a return to positive GDP growth in Q3, BCA Research wrote on Monday morning. Nevertheless, the inflationary backdrop and tight labor market conditions continue to warrant tighter monetary policy  posing a threat to the economic outlook. In its release last week of the minutes from the September meeting of its monetary policy committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and colleagues described the economys performance as expanding modestly with a strong uptick in travel and tourism along with steady or growing activity in manufacturing among the positives. But it noted weakness in retail, auto sales and housing from the central banks aggressive campaign of interest rate hikes. Still, recent earnings reports from the big banks and other barometers of consumer spending show that Americans continue to spend, even as inflation tops 8% annually and their consumption habits shift from goods to services. Our U.S. consumer clients remained resilient with strong, although slower growing, spending levels and still maintained elevated deposit amounts, CEO Brian Moynihan said in announcing the banks better-than-expected third-quarter earnings last week. Across the bank, we grew loans by 12% over the last year as we delivered the financial resources to support our clients. The stock market, often a predictor of future economic health, posted its best week since June last week, ending on Friday with a 700-plus point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow was up nearly 5% for the week. No, the economy doesnt want to die, says Sevin Yeltekin, dean of the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester. Theres a lot of resilience in a lot of places. Yet most economists are still predicting a recession within the next 12 months, although the odds of one beginning before next year appear to be receding somewhat. And some have taken heart from a suggestion late last week in The Wall Street Journal that the Fed may take a breather after its November meeting, when another 75 basis point hike in interest rates is expected. Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, added credence to that idea on Friday during a speech at the University of California-Berkeley. I think the time is now to start talking about stepping down  the time is now to start planning for stepping down, Daly said. The Fed is raising from rock bottom levels, says Nela Richardson, chief economist at private payroll and human resources firm ADP. It works with a lag. They have to hike to a higher level and then stay there. I would argue they are going to stay there for months, maybe a year. Factoring into that decision will be a report out Friday morning. The personal consumption expenditures price index is followed closely by the Fed, especially its core index that strips out food and energy costs to show how broad inflation is throughout the economy. Expectations are for it to have declined on a monthly basis in September to 0.5% from 0.6% in August. Other economic news this week will include housing prices on Tuesday and new home sales on Wednesday. The housing sector is in a slump as mortgage rates have doubled from a year ago. The week ends with the final University of Michigan consumer sentiment report for September. While readings of the consumer psyche have shown a gloomy outlook, Americans have continued to spend, bolstered by household balance sheets that are still in good shape despite the highest inflation in 40 years. The idea of shopping is ingrained, says Kathy Gramling, consumer industry markets leader at EY Americas. We can always count on the American consumer to consume."
106,"The nations economic challenges include decidedly mixed indicators: Yes, unemployment sits at 3.5%, matching a 50-year low. But the percentage of the population which is employed still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels: lower shares of both men and women were employed in September 2022 than February 2020. This problem will be front and center for the new Congress elected in just a few short weeks. But how can policymakers and business leaders fix this labor lag? They can start by closing the child care gap. As education increases, so do labor force participation and income. And rising income correlates with a further increase in the use of paid child care, according to a groundbreaking study from the Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board. As more families use such care, it enables more parents to join or return to the workforce. The study  a first-of-its-kind, four-part report series titled The Economic Role of Paid Child Care in the U.S.  is an in-depth examination of the use of paid child care and labor force participation, particularly of mothers. It shows that the problem we face is the surprising income gap between those families who use paid care and those who do not. In 2020, for example, the average income of families with children under the age of 5 who paid for care was $147,230, according to the study. The average income of such families who did not use paid child care was $96,037. Meanwhile, the median income for families in recent years was just over $80,000. This $51,193 gap between those who used paid child care and those who did not suggests that low-income families are not the only ones who struggle with the cost of care, but middle-income households do as well. Simply put, average families are not able to access the licensed market for child care after paying other monthly expenses such as rent or mortgage, utilities, food, car payments and gas. Child care is an important work support for families. Without it, many parents  particularly mothers  cannot join or rejoin the labor force. At the same time, quality child care is an early learning setting for young children. Research shows that during a childs earliest years, the brain is growing the fastest, creating a foundation for future learning, including school readiness. This makes child care a two-generation support for working families, helping parents return to the workforce while also giving kids a future-learning jump start. Increasing womens participation in the workforce would also have an unexpected financial impact: A 1% increase in womens labor force participation would generate $73 billion in new personal income, according to the CED study. This would, in turn, increase economic prosperity for the U.S. as a whole and for families with children, especially. Of course, 1% is a larger figure than it may first seem: It would entail more than 569,000 additional women ages 18 to 54 entering the labor force, including more than 210,000 with children up to age 14 and nearly 45,000 with children under 5. Achieving such an increase would require that mothers across the income spectrum  not just those from the nations wealthiest households  have access to affordable child care within their community. Beyond affordability, another challenge for families is that the child care supply falls short of the need in many communities. Research shows that across nearly three-dozen states before the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly one-third of children under age 6 with all available parents in the labor force came from families without access to child care programs. Employers depend on working parents. Working parents, in turn, depend upon child care. But the ultimate beneficiaries of quality care are children, whose healthy development and school readiness are bolstered by such programs, whether center-based or home-based. Those children are also our future workforce. In the months ahead, as policymakers and business leaders consider strategies to boost labor force participation to reduce inflation and promote economic growth, there is much to be learned through the data in our report series. With this information in hand, leaders must pursue collaborative, effective and practical solutions to establish that child care and voluntary universal preschool are integral parts of education and workforce preparation. What is needed are partnerships that bring together key stakeholders, including federal, state and local community leaders, as well as business leaders and families. We have the data. It shows we must act. Our nations economic prosperity depends on it."
107,"Its not every day that 20% of the U.S. population gets a big raise, but that is what happened Thursday when the Social Security Administration announced that recipients of its retirement benefits will get an 8.7% cost of living increase next January. The increase amounts to a raise of about $140 a month for the average Social Security benefit. The cost of living adjustment, or COLA, comes after the 66 million recipients received a 5.9% increase at the beginning of the year. The adjustments are based on the current rate of inflation. The 2023 COLA is 8.7%. More to come shortly , the SSA tweeted shortly after 8:30 Thursday morning. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday that the consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 8.2% in September. Ironically, the increase in Social Security monthly payments will start in January, by which time inflation likely will be trending downward on account of the Federal Reserves aggressive hiking of interest rates to thwart rising prices. This may be the first and possibly the last time that beneficiaries today receive a COLA this high, Mary Johnson, an analyst who tracks COLA for the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan advocacy group for retirees, told Marketwatch. Retirees will also benefit from recent moves by the Biden administration to lower prescription drug costs as part of the Build Back Better Act; as part of that legislation, insulin prices for diabetics were capped and additional support was provided for people to get health insurance. Seniors are among the highest users of medical services. There is also a drop in Medicare Part B premiums for 2023, bringing some relief to seniors when they visit doctors or use other outpatient services such as home health care. The Social Security Administrations acting Commissioner Kilolo Kijakazi told The Associated Press that the combination of lower Medicare premiums and the rise in benefits will give seniors more peace of mind and breathing room."

110,"The number of job openings fell by more than 1 million to just over 10 million in August, signaling that employers are preparing for leaner times, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. The 10.1 million openings compares to 11.3 million in July but is still a high number historically. However, while hiring remains stable the lower number of potential hires suggests companies are paring back on their future employment plans. The largest decreases came in health care and social assistance, down 236,000; other services, dropping by 183,000 and retail, falling by 143,000. The monthly report is one of many out this week on the health of the labor market, culminating in the monthly jobs number released on Friday. Economists expect that number to come in around 250,000, although it has surprised to the upside in recent months. Private payroll firm ADP will also release its monthly jobs survey on Wednesday. While other parts of the economy have begun to show the effects of higher interest rates, notably housing where home sales are off by nearly 25% from a year ago, the job market has remained resilient so far. This comes even as many economists predict the U.S. economy is headed for a recession sometime in the next year. To determine the risk of a downturn, Wells Fargo economic researchers looked at the historical differences in yields for short and long duration bonds to determine whether an inverted yield curve, where investors are getting more yield for shorter term bonds than longer ones, is a reliable indicator of a looming recession. Normally, investors are paid more for taking on longer-term debt, as that is presumed to be riskier given the unpredictability of the economy over time. When the opposite happens, it means investors are more doubtful of the economys short-term prospects. The bank looked at many different bond yields, but focused on the relationship between the 10-year and 1-year Treasuries. Recently, our preferred 10-year/1-year yield spread breached the recession-prediction threshold in August and remained negative through September, suggesting there is a 91% chance of a recession during the next 12 months, it concluded. Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, says that Fridays jobs number could well be a good one, but there are still signs the labor market may be weakening. So although we may continue to see some strong job gains for a few months to come, the party will be over soon, North says in an email. Thats because the Fed has jacked up rates so far so fast, and is going to continue doing so, that it will send the economy into recession by the end of this year or early next year. And Monster, the online job search site, is noticing a pickup in searches for part-time work, often an indicator that workers may be looking for extra work to make ends meet. Were seeing workers who already have jobs are needing to seek additional income, beyond their base salary to manage the economic impact, says Monster Economist Giacomo Santangelo in an email. This may mean taking on more work at their current job, working a second job, or seeking part-time or gig work to help meet financial obligations. We expect this trend to endure as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, driving up unemployment and leaving many workers in need of other sources of income, he added."
111,"The first working week of the fourth quarter brings a mound of trepidation for the markets and global economy. The third quarter ended on a sour note, with the U.S. market off nearly 25% for the year, as measured by the S&P 500. Globally, new British Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on her Reaganomics policy of tax cuts for the rich, while oil producing nations are considering a production cut to boost prices following the recent sharp sell-off on fears of a global economic slowdown. In the U.S., questions are being asked about the Federal Reserves hawkish policy of raising interest rates to inflict pain on consumers and businesses alike as bond yields surge, stocks crater and the housing sector heads into a tailspin. A measure of inflation the Fed follows closely rose in August from July even as the Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points in three consecutive moves. Then there is the devastating loss of life and property from Hurricane Ian, with the death toll at 87 already and estimates of damage topping $100 billion. President Joe Biden will visit Florida on Wednesday, but the storm also hit the Carolinas this weekend where four of the 87 died. He will also visit Puerto Rico on Monday. And, to add insult to injury, there are real concerns about Russia as it suffers humiliating losses in its war against Ukraine and as President Vladimir Putin rattles the nuclear saber. The year of geopolitics is coming to a crescendo in the fourth quarter, BCA Research warned Friday in its latest geopolitical survey. The investment firm focused on what it considers the overriding themes driving the global outlook: great power rivalry, hypo-globalization, and populism/nationalism. These are playing out with Russias proxy war with NATO, the Russia-EU economic divorce, the fourth Taiwan Strait crisis, and the looming crisis with Iran, BCA says. The end result is unstable markets and a rush to safe havens such as the U.S. dollar, now up 16% this year against the worlds other major currencies. A strong dollar wreaks havoc with corporate earnings for U.S. companies that have a large percentage of foreign sales while making it more expensive for economies outside the U.S. to export their goods and pay for commodities that are priced in dollars. The dollars rise is a direct result of the Feds interest rate policies. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has insisted he will continue raising rates until inflation is quelled and the out of balance labor market returns to a more normal state even at the expense of a recession. So far, the higher rates the Fed has engineered have had a measurable effect in some quarters of the economy, crushing the inflated values in the stock market and leaving pending home sales 24% below where they were a year ago. But the labor market has yet to buckle. This week brings a slew of readings on the current state of the jobs environment. Tuesday will bring a report on job openings for the end of August with expectations of a slight drop from July, but still 11 million open positions or about two for every potential worker. On Wednesday, private payroll firm ADP will issue its September survey of hiring, with 200,000 new jobs expected to be added after Augusts 132,000 increase. On Thursday, there will be another weekly report on filings for unemployment benefits following last weeks 193,000, a number that hardly suggests a weak job market. Then Friday comes the big number, the September jobs report from the Labor Department. Economists expect a number of around 250,000, but the reports have been surprisingly good of late and even the forecast number is one that would be considered good in normal times. Economists at Wells Fargos corporate and investment banking group project a jobs number of 275,000. While still healthy, our call is well below the 438K YTD and nearly 800K post-pandemic averages as labor market gains are continuing to slow in response to tighter monetary policy, they wrote Sunday. That said, business surveys continue to point to a labor market that is still positive and running at a pace that is still above a sustainable run-rate given labor force growth and population trends. We look for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7% and for average hourly earnings to continue at a similar pace to what we have seen so far this year  rising 0.4% m/m (5.1% yr/yr). That would still reflect a tight labor market and one with wage pressures inconsistent with inflation coming back down to target, the bank said. Notably, Fridays job number will be the last before the Feds November meeting of its monetary policy group where experts see another interest rate hike of magnitude. Given developments overseas and the unpredictable nature of Russias Putin or Chinas Xi Jinping, theres nothing to suggest the beginning of the fourth quarter will bring anything but more frayed nerves on Wall and Main Streets."

113,"Home prices rose 15.8% in July, down from a month earlier as higher mortgage rates put a brake on demand, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national monthly survey released Tuesday. The monthly rate reflects the slowdown in increases from earlier this year as mortgage rates have doubled. In June, prices rose at an 18.1% rate. The sharp rise in housing costs is a direct result of the Federal Reserves attack on inflation through increases in interest rates. Although U.S. housing prices remain substantially above their year-ago levels, July's report reflects a forceful deceleration, said Craig Lazzara, director at S&P DJI. The theme of strong but decelerating prices was reflected across all 20 cities. Tampa, Miami and Dallas posted the highest year-over-year increases in price, at 31.8%, 31.7% and 24.7%, respectively. Housing had been a standout of the pandemic recovery as people sought larger homes and relocated while mortgage rates were at historically low levels. But housing has also been a contributor to inflation that is running at more than an 8% annual rate. Todays S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller index highlights this past summers cooling in real estate activity, with buyers reeling from double-digit jumps in monthly mortgage payments in July as rates floated above 5%, George Ratiu, senior economist & manager of economic research for Realtor.com, wrote ahead of the report. The combination of still-tight inventory in most markets and buyers trying to lock in a fixed monthly payment before rates rose even higher ensured that prices continued advancing, Ratiu added. However, the upward momentum has lost steam and it is clear that the market peak is now firmly behind us. The slowdown in prices comes as existing home sales are down nearly 20% from last year and new home sales fell 12.6% in July, following a drop in May. Sales for August are being reported on Tuesday. The fundamental supply-demand imbalance is likely to keep house prices appreciating, but rising mortgage rates will slow appreciation to a much more sustainable pace, Mark Fleming, chief economist at title insurer First American, wrote early Tuesday. As this house appreciation slows, buyers who were sidelined in the super hot seller's market may jump back into the market, he added."

Ironically, the increase in Social Security monthly payments will start in January, by which time inflation likely will be trending downward on account of the Federal Reserves aggressive hiking of interest rates to thwart rising prices. This may be the first and possibly the last time that beneficiaries today receive a COLA this high, Mary Johnson, an analyst who tracks COLA for the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan advocacy group for retirees, told Marketwatch. Retirees will also benefit from recent moves by the Biden administration to lower prescription drug costs as part of the Build Back Better Act; as part of that legislation, insulin prices for diabetics were capped and additional support was provided for people to get health insurance. Seniors are among the highest users of medical services. There is also a drop in Medicare Part B premiums for 2023, bringing some relief to seniors when they visit doctors or use other outpatient services such as home health care. The Social Security Administrations acting Commissioner Kilolo Kijakazi told The Associated Press that the combination of lower Medicare premiums and the rise in benefits will give seniors more peace of mind and breathing room."
118,"The number of job openings fell by more than 1 million to just over 10 million in August, signaling that employers are preparing for leaner times, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. The 10.1 million openings compares to 11.3 million in July but is still a high number historically. However, while hiring remains stable the lower number of potential hires suggests companies are paring back on their future employment plans. The largest decreases came in health care and social assistance, down 236,000; other services, dropping by 183,000 and retail, falling by 143,000. The monthly report is one of many out this week on the health of the labor market, culminating in the monthly jobs number released on Friday. Economists expect that number to come in around 250,000, although it has surprised to the upside in recent months. Private payroll firm ADP will also release its monthly jobs survey on Wednesday. While other parts of the economy have begun to show the effects of higher interest rates, notably housing where home sales are off by nearly 25% from a year ago, the job market has remained resilient so far. This comes even as many economists predict the U.S. economy is headed for a recession sometime in the next year. To determine the risk of a downturn, Wells Fargo economic researchers looked at the historical differences in yields for short and long duration bonds to determine whether an inverted yield curve, where investors are getting more yield for shorter term bonds than longer ones, is a reliable indicator of a looming recession. Normally, investors are paid more for taking on longer-term debt, as that is presumed to be riskier given the unpredictability of the economy over time. When the opposite happens, it means investors are more doubtful of the economys short-term prospects. The bank looked at many different bond yields, but focused on the relationship between the 10-year and 1-year Treasuries. Recently, our preferred 10-year/1-year yield spread breached the recession-prediction threshold in August and remained negative through September, suggesting there is a 91% chance of a recession during the next 12 months, it concluded. Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, says that Fridays jobs number could well be a good one, but there are still signs the labor market may be weakening. So although we may continue to see some strong job gains for a few months to come, the party will be over soon, North says in an email. Thats because the Fed has jacked up rates so far so fast, and is going to continue doing so, that it will send the economy into recession by the end of this year or early next year. And Monster, the online job search site, is noticing a pickup in searches for part-time work, often an indicator that workers may be looking for extra work to make ends meet. Were seeing workers who already have jobs are needing to seek additional income, beyond their base salary to manage the economic impact, says Monster Economist Giacomo Santangelo in an email. This may mean taking on more work at their current job, working a second job, or seeking part-time or gig work to help meet financial obligations. We expect this trend to endure as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, driving up unemployment and leaving many workers in need of other sources of income, he added."
122,"Forget transitory. Forget the soft landing. Reality is setting in that the markets and the economy will not get out of the Federal Reserves aggressive battle against inflation without a recession. About the only question now is how bad it gets. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to concede the point last week after announcing the central banks third consecutive 75 basis point hike in interest rates, the medicine it has prescribed for the rampant inflation. No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be, Powell told reporters following the announcement. Thats going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored and also if we get more labor supply. Markets have already made up their mind on how this movie ends. Following Friday's 486-point selloff, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week at its lowest point since 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the economy. Bond yields rose, meanwhile, sending Treasuries to 11-year highs with the 10-year near 3.7% and the 2-year yield above 4.1%. The fact investors are asking for more on the shorter duration bond says they think the economy faces greater risk in the short term than the future. Wells Fargo Corporate and Investment Bank Econometrician Azhar Iqbal and Economic Analyst Nicole Cervi wrote on Friday that a recession in the next year is more likely than not, in our view. We do not believe the U.S. economy is in a recession at present, they added. Our forecast calls for a recession starting in Q1-2023 with three consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth and output growth turning positive in Q4-2023. The Fed is hoping that raising interest rates will cool economic demand enough to dampen the still-strong labor market and its recent projections see the unemployment rate reaching 3.9% in 2023 and 4.1 in 2024 from its current 3.7%. But no one really knows what level of job losses it will take to arrest wage inflation at a time when the labor force is facing significant demographic changes. One area of the economy that is already seeing the effects of the Feds moves is housing. As mortgage rates have reached levels that are double what they were a year ago, sales of existing homes have slumped for seven straight months and are now down about 20% from a year ago. Prices, meanwhile, are no longer rising at the pace they were in 2021. Its quite a turnaround for the Fed and the Biden White House, which held on to the idea of inflation as transitory throughout most of 2021 even as consumer prices began their ascent to levels not seen since the 1980s. Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus engineered by Congress and the Fed juiced the economy, and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of this year drove energy prices and overall inflation upward. Until recently, the markets seemed skeptical that the Fed really meant it in terms of squeezing the economy hard enough to break inflation, forcing Powell to hammer the point home in August at the Feds summer symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct, Powell said, while not taking any questions. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth. Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. The markets sold off after Powell spoke, but then recovered somewhat as traders still believed the Fed would perhaps ease back in early 2023. Last week, the markets threw in the towel with the Feds September meeting ending with the third consecutive 75 basis point hike in interest rates. The Fed did more than just raise interest rates. It provided an update to its economic forecast and sharply reduced the outlook for the near term. Growth in the nations gross domestic product was revised downward for 2022, falling from 1.7% as recently as June to 0.2% now. Forecasts for 2023 were trimmed and the Fed now says the economy will operate below trend growth until 2025. The impression one gets from the (revised forecasts) and Powells remarks is that the (Fed) is in for a very challenging few years and is operating in uncharted waters, Robert Eisenbeis, vice chairman & chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors, wrote last week. On Sunday, in an appearance on CBS Face the Nation, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic sounded a positive note, saying: I do think that were going to do all that we can at the Federal Reserve to avoid deep, deep pain. The government will release updated inflation data for August on Friday from the personal consumption expenditure price index, a measure that is closely followed by the Fed. Forecasts are for the PCE to show a drop to a 6% annual rate from its current 6.3%, although there is a chance the month-over-month data will post a small increase. Its not just the U.S. that is feeling the pain. Europe is facing high inflation, an energy crisis from its dependence on Russian gas, and weakened currencies from a dollar that has rallied as the rest of the world suffers. In the U.K., where the Bank of England has already declared a recession is underway, new Prime Minister Liz Truss proposed tax cuts were met with a drop in the markets and the pounds value."
123,"It makes little difference whether the government wears a red badge, a blue badge or any other colour for that matter. Political ideology is all but dead. The markets confirmed that by killing off Truss and her version of Thatcherism. The result is that whoever is in power (for a long time to come)  economic decisions are guided by what markets have the stomach for. The result right now is that Rishi Sunak has neither the power or the time to make any significant changes other than calming markets. Taxes are at their highest in 70 years and taxing the middle classes, their pensions, investments or otherwise is politically now a no-go area. Perhaps applying temporary windfall taxes to the energy companies and the banks will help in the short term. Labour would, quite rightly, have a go at corporate tax dodgers  but none of this will produce the types of long-term revenue required to engage in an ideology. Socialism, the type that Corbyn was proposing (that caused a swing to the political right), has never worked, nor has extreme neoliberal capitalism, trickle-down economics or even Brexit. The left and right wings of political ideology are now dead in the water. It is because of these failed attempts that the state of the nations financial health is where it is. There is, effectively, no fiscal bandwidth left. Whichever way you look at it though, economic growth is what really counts. If the economy stagnates, so do living standards. It really is that simple. There are things that can be done to stimulate growth  but they all take time. Trussonomics is the biggest indicator to politicians that the markets are now in control  because the tipping point in just every facet of borrowing or financial speculation has been reached. As said, there is no bandwidth. Decarbonisation, innovation, trade, education and public health are all areas where we could see economic growth coming from  but a government destined to fail in the short-term will not invest for a long-term return. Being a winner in the global race to Net Zero and pushing on with our strategic advantage in science and technology are fundamental to growth. Making the most of Brexit in a rapidly changing world will take years but must be focused upon if Britain is to become anything that resembles a trading powerhouse. Having a plan for Brexit might help! A technical revolution in education and public health will drive economic improvement, not just in the workplace but help to level up regions. Seizing these opportunities would make us more competitive, more dynamic and most importantly future-focused. It was innovation and technology that drove the industrial revolution of 1760 to 1840. It brought about sweeping changes in economic and social organisation. But the reality of today is simple. Britain no longer has the technical advantages it had over its competition. But now Britain has another problem. Rishi Sunak is now this months version of a Tory Prime Minister on the ideological right and the Tories have proved something  they now lack the judgement needed when it comes to making decisions in the best interests of our country. And Sunak has an enviable CV when it comes to misjudgements. Sunak supported Camerons referendum that went on to crash the country into an economic wall in the guise of Brexit. He backed Boris Johnson who crashed himself into every wall possible. And in the midst of a deadly pandemic  Sunak subsidised people to dine out with no vaccine in sight causing a rapid incline in cases and no doubt many deaths with it. Sunak has said nothing about what to do about Brexit  the one major economic policy that is holding this country back. Lets be fair; politically he backed Johnson and worked next to him in a government that collapsed  twice. And just because Sunak understood the insanity of pushing unfunded tax cuts in a period of fiscal and current account deficits  with a looming recession, it is not proof of his ability to manage a country. After all, I predicted Brexit, the loss of several Tory PMs and a recession  it still doesnt qualify me for an advisory seat at the top table in No10. Rishi Sunak is in a government that has failed in everything it touches when it comes to the economy and general well-being of the country. Indeed, by many standards, everything is worse. And because everything is worse, investors are taking a dim view of the future prospects of the United Kingdom. This is another reason why there is less financial bandwidth  because everything is at breaking point. Our currency and bond markets are teetering on the edge of a cliff. A single miss-step and mayhem is triggered. But economic activity comes from having more than just good management of the economic machinery. The NHS is not just in a crisis  its in an existential crisis. There are 7 million on waiting lists with 9 to 10 million expected by this time in 2024. Leading education organisations have written to the government warning of the looming education funding crisis. The leaders of 12 education bodies in England said school and college funding had been cut to the bone over the past decade and a real-terms cut in spending would be catastrophic. They are warning of reductions in teaching and support staff, larger class sizes, cuts to the curriculum and student support services. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said schools are already on their knees because they just dont have the requisite funding to do the job thats required. Whats going to happen is schools are going to have to narrow their timetable, narrow their range of subjects offer. Were looking at a huge decline in things like design and technology, and creative subjects In other words  to put in the words of the experts  There is a very real risk of a decline in educational standards. Investors with a long-term horizon dont look upon an unhealthy, uneducated population as the place where they can prosper  they go elsewhere. We have an ongoing housing crisis ( and whats the point in government if they cant even house their own people) and a social care crisis that is the ticking time bomb of the next two decades. On top of all this, to distract the government from its duty of care to its own country  Putins attack on Ukraine continues to undermine the global economy and the fracturing of world geopolitics and international relationships. All the while, Sunak is now in charge of a government in breakdown mode. Indeed, in many respects, Britain looks a lot like the political rot undermining America. This is a government that has wantonly and willfully attacked the institutions that support civil society. It has fully encouraged and engaged in a cynical culture war simply to gain votes and actively looked to divide the nation and its constituent parts. The centre-right think tank Onward published results of its latest poll findings and found, even to their horror, a home truth. One-third of all voters said they would never vote for the Conservatives again in their lifetime. Another 50 per cent would probably not vote Tory again. And if ever there was one statistic that says it all, it is this  since 2019, the average age of a Tory voter has lept by 14 years. No one dare say this but in little more than a decade there will be more people aged 65 than 18  and look at the damage these ageing voters have caused in the last ten years. Brexit is the root cause of political divisiveness and given the lack of rational argument for it  it was replaced by a cynical trashing of expert opinion in favour of an era long gone and delivered by those with no ethical or moral compass. This profound degeneration of standards in public life has seen the Tory party not just become ungovernable  it has to all intents and purposes already imploded. What the UK really needs is good people at the top with the national interest at heart. A banker that lit the touchpaper that crashed our financial system in the UK for personal gains, such as Sunak, should not be anywhere near the levers of power. This fact tells you everything you need to know about the system failure we are in right now. Sunak is no statesman  yesterdays wooden acceptance speech confirmed that. Sunak is no Lloyd George, Atlee or Thatcher and will be unable to control the many undisciplined factions within his own party. He has no real vision of what needs to be done for the future of Britain other than sidestepping economic traps. It is very sad to witness and then have to admit  Britain continues its downwards spiral towards insignificance. A once great nation, proud of its achievements and place in the world  now on its knees to a few traders in the FX and bond market. We are a sliver of our former self  made so much worse in the last decade by the feral activities of self-serving liars and charlatans who promised sunlit uplands and delivered nothing but division and decay. Sunak cannot possibly overcome these systemic problems  that will take years of good governance, an ability the Tory party lost a long time ago."
124,"Economically speaking, there is nothing positive on the horizon for Britain. There are no sunlit uplands as promised by our veritable so-called leaders. The economy is about to spiral out of control. Britain is not about to suddenly find the economic holy grail of policy-making just because yet another Tory hopeful has a stab at stemming the failures of her predecessors. Theyve tried. Theyve failed. Indeed, even Thatchers neoliberal drive, which did work, now doesnt. You only have to look at the privatization of water to see that failure dramatically spewing its ideology all over Britains beaches. There is no new industrial revolution or a 21st-century equivalent of it for Britain. We wont find a new energy source that will revolutionise the world or invent a new technical advantage over all others as we have done in our historical past. Thats the problem with technology  everyone catches up so quickly. Liz Truss will do the same as the three previous Tory Prime Ministers. She will fail. And when she does, like the last three efforts  we will all have to pay. So what now for the economy? Truss is going for broke  literally. She thinks that her policies are somehow untried (by three decades of the last four in Tory hands) anywhere in the Western world  when, in fact, they have. Strangely enough, America is the biggest example of deregulation  but as Joe Biden announced yesterday  trickle down economics, which is exactly what Truss is about to hype up  has failed. So, in a country where we have a national debt equivalent to 100 per cent of GDP  facing an energy inflation spike that wont easily go away and a more general cost of living crisis that will quickly erode living standards, what will Truss do? Lowering taxes for the poor by 63 pence wont do it. Lowering taxes for the wealthy wont do it. Lowering taxes on corporations wont either (because trickle-down theory is now a known failure). My guess is she will go for broke. She will attempt to become a low-tax champion. And in the type of economy we have right now  balanced on the edge of a recession, with record high employment (meaning little bandwidth to increase output), she will spook the money markets. Targeting the housing market i.e. yet more intervention into a so-called free market to distort reality will not work. In normal markets, eliminating stamp duty will overheat house prices in the short-term. Eventually they will slow or correct in the medium term. But will it really do anything this time? It could if several million properties suddenly came to market  but thats not possible. And while house prices have defied the principles of economic gravity over the last few years, they simply cant keep going because theres only one trajectory right now  an inevitable increase of base rate interest rates. In other words, mortage payments will start increasing  quickly. Activity in the housing market will over-compensate and all but stop. So what else will kick start the economy? Not much is the answer. The reason is money. You need lots of it to invest in projects that actually do give you an edge. Education? Every year, the OECD releases its results on the global rankings of students in maths, reading and science across 72 countries. It shows the UK failing to come in the top ten in any of the three categories. Performing consistently well across the board, however, are several Asian countries, notably Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea. European countries such as Switzerland, Ireland, Finland and Estonia also stand out. The problem with education is that it takes years to see real results  and politics is very short-termism at best. In reality  Britain has failed to keep up because of political ideology. And education is just one example of the many problems that represent the incremental decline of Britain. Ideological Extremists Those on the hard-right of the economic spectrum have all but guaranteed more failure. Today, thats called neoliberal capitalism. It is the same with the fantasies of those on the far left of socialism. Theres never enough money. Both have to be kept in check by affordability  or you go bankrupt. Liz Truss and her new Chancellor are about to make some big economic wrong-turns. The money markets will quickly turn against them. The cost of borrowing for the government, businesses and for homeowners with mortgages will quickly head north. This, in turn, will push more inflation into the economy  which will push the value of the pound Sterling downward  that in turn  will push inflation up again. Its a financial death spiral  and it takes huge financial intervention to stop it once that trajectory takes hold. We dont hold US dollar reserves to fight back. We dont have gold reserves to sell and raise capital. The bond markets will lose confidence. What then?"
125,"Jacob Rees-Mogg is now the man in charge of our hard-won workers rights as the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. The UKs last two prime ministers, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, both promised that Brexit would not weaken employment rights and that EU-derived protections would be retained or replaced by something even better. Reportedly, though, Liz Truss does not feel bound by the same promise and appears to have brought in arch-Brexiteer Rees-Mogg to shred these rights. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has called for the government to come clean over its plans. So what hints can we get from Rees-Moggs own words about workers rights over the years? 1. An end to EU rights to time off? In 2016, Channel 4s Jon Snow asked Rees-Mogg if he supported keeping the following EU-derived employment rights listed by the TUCs Nicola Smith: Paid holiday, paid rest breaks, rights for time off if youve got kids and your kids are unwell, protection from discrimination when youre pregnant. Rees-Mogg replied: I dont support all these employment rights that come from Europe. 2. Sacking striking workers? In 2011, Rees-Mogg called on the government to sack striking border officials, imitating the robust action of the late US president Ronald Reagan in relation to recalcitrant air traffic controllers. In the notorious incident in 1981, Reagan sacked 11,359 striking workers and banned them from ever working for the government again. In Britain, workers have been protected from being sacked for lawful striking since 1871, and Moggs suggestion was so extreme it drew chuckles and groans and was ignored by Cameron. Truss threatened to impose minimum standards agreements that would hinder unions rights to lawful strikes during her leadership campaign, but even she hasnt suggested sacking workers who exercise their right to strike  yet. 3. Longer working weeks? Rees-Mogg complained in 2016 that Europe had effectively duped Britain into abiding by the Working Time Directive (which guarantees paid time off and stops workers being forced to work more than 48 hours a week). Calling the EU a failed state, he said that the European Court of Justice had interpreted the [EU] treaties to mean completely different things from what we believed we had signed up to, so, for example, the Working Time Directive came in under health and safety laws even when we had an opt-out from the social chapter [the part of EU treaty law that protects employment and other social rights]. Rees-Mogg had previously told parliament that he thought it was remarkable that the UN human rights convention covered paid time off, saying It is hard to believe that the right to paid holiday is an absolute moral right. 4. A lower minimum wage  or none at all? As a member of the red-wall-courting Johnson government, Rees-Mogg occasionally defended the minimum wage. But as a backbencher, he opposed its increase and even its existence. In 2012, he coyly said: Mr Deputy Speaker, you will rule me out of order if I argue that raising the minimum wage would be extremely unwise, so I would not dare to say it. Writing in the Telegraph in 2014, he said the government should not raise the minimum wage  then £6.31 an hour  because that would lead either to inflation or to unemployment. Rather than setting any minimum wage at all, he said the government should permit the free market to set wages. 5. More zero-hours contracts? In 2013 he decried lefties seeking to ban zero-hours contracts, saying it was useful for business to have access to a pool of people who could be called into work at short notice but are not guaranteed a specific level of employment, adding that while workers with other obligations could say no sometimes, naturally, they cannot refuse too often. Such contracts, he argued, benefit business, consumers and taxpayers by keeping costs down and they boost productivity allowing the efficient use of labour, as well as offering a route into employment. 6. More two-tier workforces with exploited, rights-free agency staff? In May this year, Jacob Rees-Mogg picked the nine most interesting ideas for Brexit benefits to pursue, from 2,000 suggestions from the British public, including scrapping equal rights for agency workers, along with niche issues such as allowing more powerful vacuum cleaners and electric bikes. The pick  which could see agency workers losing basic rights like paid holiday, for example  was not a surprise. In the 2016 Channel 4 interview mentioned above, Rees-Mogg had singled out EU protections for agency workers as very unhelpful and among elements that I would change. 7. Lower pay for the regions and fewer bargaining rights for unions? Teachers and NHS staff have, for decades, had their pay set nationally, meaning poorer areas can attract staff and unions have power to negotiate for large numbers. But in 2012 Jacob Rees-Mogg called not just for a huge extension of local pay (that is, lower pay in some regions) but also small, isolated negotiations in every workplace: I urge Her Majestys government to go much further and to abolish national pay bargaining altogether [and] we need to go much further so that every school and every hospital decides the pay rates that it will give its employees. Truss appeared to suggest  then quickly back away from  a policy of lower regional pay during her leadership campaign, but even she hasnt suggested setting it at such a micro level (yet). 8. More graft for workers? In August, Rees-Mogg backed Liz Trusss leaked comments that British workers needed more graft, telling the Mail on Sunday that her remarks were sensible and reflected an unfortunate reality. 9. More rights for bosses? In February 2022, Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Times that the government needed to reform employment rights as the power had shifted too far to employees. A flexible labour market is essential to our economic prosperity have we got that right? Well, we must of course look at that and see who needs protection and who doesnt Sometimes the employer would think they need more protection from the employee. 10. Fewer employment and welfare rights in general? In an introduction to a series of essays published by right-wing think tank Politeia in 2012, Rees Mogg said that: Deregulation is part of [his vision of Conservatism], especially in employment law. If society is wrapped in cotton wool, it will never prosper. Naturally, there needs to be some safety net for those who fail but unless some are allowed to fall none will be able to climb. 11. Paternalism in place of rights? Jacob Rees-Mogg is fond of citing the merits of the Victorian factory owners. He told MPs that in the Victorian age most employers were benevolent, kindly, good and not out of a Dickens novel: they were more Trollope than Dickens by and large. And in a 2012 debate on slavery and child labour in supply chains, he expressed doubts that the bill achieved its desired objectives, supporting some regulation but suggesting that it could be minimised by starting with conscience and the fact that companies that fail to follow the basics of humanity will be embarrassed in their marketing. They will be brought to shame in front of the nation."
126,"Imagine that a hostile power managed to infiltrate the UKs government. Imagine that it set out to demoralise and debilitate this country, destroying our sense of common purpose, undermining our stability and trashing the lives of many of our citizens. Imagine that it had to operate below the radar, within the structures of a nominally democratic system. Lets follow this thought experiment for a moment. What would such a hostile force set out to do? It would seek, first of all, to destroy trust. The people it planted in the government would lie prolifically, then lie about the lies, until we were so disoriented we no longer knew what to believe. They would damage our sense of national cohesion with a blatant disregard for the rules the rest of us must follow. They would seek to ensure that we lost faith in the political system and ceased to believe that those who govern us have our best interests at heart. The hostile power would also set out to destroy, through subtle and insidious cuts, our social infrastructure: the effective delivery of health, education, social, environmental and local services. It would allow our physical infrastructure  public transport, sewerage, public buildings and other essential services  to deteriorate until, in some cases, it came close to collapse. It would attack and undermine crucial symbols of national pride, such as the NHS, the BBC, the National Trust and the universities. It would further harm our sense of nationhood by trashing much of what we treasure and love, such as clean rivers, the green belt and well-planned cities. It would sow division by promoting inequality, enabling a prosperous elite to accumulate ever more of the countrys wealth. After all, as George Orwell remarked during the second world war, the lady in the Rolls-Royce car is more damaging to morale than a fleet of Goerings bombing planes. It would impede trading relations with our neighbours and major economic partners, in the hope of cutting us off from the world. It would undermine peace agreements and impose internal borders. It would allow crime to run rampant, permitting an explosion of devastating fraud and financial crimes such as money laundering that further harm our international standing and the concept of equality before the law. Far from stamping out profiteering during a national crisis, the hostile power would create a special channel, enabling favoured interests to guzzle public money. Its hard to think of a better policy for destroying trust in public life and the sense that we are all in this together. You can see where this is going. It sometimes seems to me that if this government had set out to harm our country, it could scarcely have done a better job. It seems perversely committed to the destruction of civic life, national pride and a sense of belonging. You can more or less predict Tory policy on any issue by asking yourself: Whats the most toxic and harmful strategy they could hope to get away with? So what is going on? Has a hostile power managed to infiltrate the UK government? In a way, yes. That power is oligarchic capital. At the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that people who have donated at least £250,000 to the Conservative party have been invited to join an advisory board, with special access to the prime minister, cabinet ministers and senior government advisers. They have used this access to lobby for changes in government policy. The 14 identified members of the group have a combined wealth of at least £30bn, and have donated £22m to the Conservatives. Among them are property tycoons, financiers, two people with connections to the Kremlin, a tobacco magnate and an internet entrepreneur currently facing trial for rape and sexual assault (both of which he denies). The group and its agenda had hitherto been kept secret. The Sunday Times reporting was based on a trove of leaked documents. The advisory group appears to cross the line that separates party business from government business, especially as the official facilitating it is on the public payroll. We have also been told that the Conservative party is helping its donors to apply for key government positions, which looks like another obvious transgression of the line. Another tranche of leaked documents suggest that offering a golden ladder to prestigious public appointments is used as leverage when persuading them to part with their money. Political funding has long been a means by which the very rich can exercise inordinate influence over public policy. But this influence now seems to have become cruder and more extreme than at any time in living memory. Far from seeking to contain plutocratic power, Boris Johnson hopes to strip the Electoral Commission of its powers to stop abuses of the funding system. Big donors are not the only oligarchs with inordinate influence over this government. Dominic Cummings claimed that Boris Johnson referred to the Telegraph, owned by the billionaire Frederick Barclay, as my real boss. Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives have held several private meetings with Johnson and members of his cabinet. Are the very rich deliberately trying to harm our country? In some cases, perhaps. There is a strand of capitalism that wants to generate crises and then seize national assets at fire-sale prices. But no such intention is required to explain the general damage inflicted by oligarchic capital. It is simply that the interests of the very rich are not the same as the interests of the nation. We should never forget what the billionaire stockbroker Peter Hargreaves, who donated £3.2m to one of the leave campaigns, said about Brexit: We will get out there and we will become incredibly successful because we will be insecure again. And insecurity is fantastic. No responsible government would allow the demands of the ultra-rich to override the needs of the nation. But we have no responsible government."
127,"Looking at the headlines in the print media recently and youd be forgiven for thinking the country was in an unstoppable downward economic spiral. Perhaps it is. For instance, retail sales fell sharply in August and continue to do so as UK consumers struggle with soaring prices and high energy costs. This has actually been happening since mid summer. The reality is that retail sales are now shrinking. It is speeding up the approach of a recession and is piling even more pressure on a dejected pound. One very expected outcome is that the UK jobs market is now on course to lose some steam, which is driven by firms cutting levels of staff in response to their own increasing costs and weaker consumer spending, a new survey revealed. Even with Prime Minister Liz Trusss decision to freeze household energy bills at (an average) £2,500 for two years at a cost of £150bn  inflation still breached double digits, albeit it will likely reduce the severity of the depth of the coming recession. Real wages have not kept up. It doesnt help that the latest data from HMRC has seen Brexit deliver a devastating blow to business. The number of UK businesses exporting goods to the EU fell 33 per cent to 18,357 in 2021, from 27,321 in 2020. Exactly one-third of businesses exporting to the EU have given up. This has caused the UKs trade performance this year to fall to its worst level since records began in 1955. And the cause, according to analysts  is all down to Brexit. To top this  Sterling fell in value against the USD to its lowest level since 1985, bounced and fell back again  after yet another round of weaker than expected data on UK retail sales, which amplified concerns that the country is headed for a prolonged recession. I reported six months ago that by the start of the last quarter, Britain would be in recession, irrespective of whether it was technical or not. Olivia Cross, economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggest that the downward momentum is gathering speed and supported her view that the economy is already in recession. There are multiple reasons why Britain is doing worse than its peers. The recent falls of educational standards (in comparison to peer nations) is up there. Privatisation of critical infrastructure has been a disaster. Water is a prime example  so is energy. The former is polluting just about everything to such an extent that tourism is being affected. This is hardly surprising with headlines from across the Atlantic such as  Sewage-covered beaches risk turning England into the dirty man of Europe Just a few weeks ago, it was reported that the very lovely Lake Windemere had become so polluted the water was as toxic as Cobra venom and posed a serious health risk. Regarding energy, the UK was paying the second highest amount for its electricity supply in the whole of Europe, topped only by the Czech Republic just two months ago. Since then, wholesale energy prices have fallen back somewhat  according to the Household Energy Price Index (HEPI). And yet, prices have not fallen for the consumer. The system is broken  obviously. Then theres the growing public health crisis. Just prior to the pandemic, UK healthcare was already on the slide. Generally recognised by most standards as being inside the top three best-performing systems in the world in 2010, it has now moved ten places down the ranks to 13th. This is a rapid decline by any standards. Poor handling of the pandemic and underfunding in the NHS has left hundreds of thousands of workers unable to work. Hidden Crisis Then theres the hidden crisis. Last year the top-earning 3 per cent of UK households each took home about £84,000 after tax. This puts Britains highest earners comfortably among the global elite. But as the Financial Times has recently reported on the same subject  While the top earners rank fifth, the average household ranks 12th and the poorest 5 per cent rank 15th. Far from simply losing touch with their western European peers, last year the lowest-earning bracket of British households had a standard of living that was 20 per cent weaker than their counterparts in Slovenia. Fifteen years ago, the average UK household was 8 per cent worse off than its peers in north-western Europe. But now things are so much worse as that income deficit has since rocketed to a record 20 per cent. This means that on the current trajectory, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024. Not only that, but the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade. Think about that for a moment. Low paid British workers could be going to Slovenia or Poland to better their lives than staying in the UK. Britain also did much worse than the Americans. Five years of pre-pandemic economic growth in US saw living standards basically lift all boats. Again, the data shows that this trend was totally absent in the UK. If this trajectory continues, the growing middle classes will continue to be eviscerated, the poor will get poorer  but there will be many more of them  and the rich will grow richer. This is a toxic cocktail that always ends badly. Governance Of course, all of these poor outcomes (pre or post-pandemic) are the result of nothing other than poor economic management. The Tory party has fully demonstrated in the twelve years it has been in power that it is now hopelessly out of depth. Drowning Street seems an accurate description of the problems being created in No 10 and No11. The growing health crisis will continue to grow and many other services will decline as treasury revenues fall against soaring borrowing. One in five of Britains population now lives in relative poverty. As The Times reports today  Real wages continue to fall despite the UKs unemployment rate dropping to its lowest level since 1974, official figures reveal today. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows sharply rising inflation outpaced wage growth, leading to a decrease in real total pay of 2.4 per cent year-on-year in the three months to August. Household debt is soaring. Homelessness, the ultimate indicator of political and economic failure, is on the rise. The number of actual homeless people is up 17 per cent against pre-pandemic measurements  and the number of social tenants becoming homeless has doubled. The present government will not be able to stop a recession or a lengthy period of stagnation (at best) and declining living standards for the vast majority of households for a considerable period of time. As recession tightens its grip, investors look elsewhere; the pound falls further  the feeling grows that youre in an economic death spiral. And so it will be. Next year will not be a happy one."
129,"Theyve backed the currency into a corner. Whilst a crashing Pound can be good for equities (as about three-quarters of the FTSE are in international markets), its not good for much else. Even those that crow on about exports being easier forget that 70 per cent of raw materials used in exports have to be imported first. The lesson about free markets and Brexit to stimulate growth are on show and will be painful to watch. The Bank of England is attempting to stem rising inflation  the government is going for growth  which leads to inflation. The Pound now sits at an all-time low. And whilst many other currencies around the world are suffering from a strong US Dollar  few countries shot themselves in the foot (like Brexit and borrowing) to make matters worse. Interest rates will go up, inflation will go up and the economy will stagnate. Worse, a recession gains speed. Liz Truss is not actually well supported within the Tory party and public opinion is not on her side. The slump in the Pound is a message. Its situation was better than it is today when the dotcom crash happened, when 911 stopped the world  when the financial crisis threatened everything and when Brexit arrived. All of those events were not as bad as it is today. Today is the final straw that broke the camels back. Once again, the party that has dominated this country for nearly 13 years have to admit  theyve failed  and failed big time. The Tory party has proved beyond doubt that it is not a One Nation party. The same can be said that it is not a party of fiscal responsibility. It cares little about the multiple crises burning at the heels of society. Public health, education, social care, security  you name it, nothing is better after 13 years. They blamed everything from immigrants to experts and now both are needed more than ever. As I wrote last week  this is the economic Brexit that leading right-wing Tories and their political commentators demanded. This is what the right-wing press, such as the Daily Mail, Express and The Sun shouted loudest about. This is what the grey vote was about  a rebuke to the future and our younger generations. Its here and its real. Brexit has caused economic activity to fall by around 4 per cent of GDP. It has caused relationships with our trading partners to become terribly strained. The so-called special relationship with the USA has imploded and the Union of Britain has created even greater tensions than ever before. Now that the Pound has crashed, investors are seeking new grounds making our future prospects even more grim. The cost of living crisis now looks like it will only get worse as the government loses control of the economy. The Tory party, its ideology and its Brexit have been mugged by the reality of the markets and overall sentiment about Britains long-term outlook. Its grim. Theres no good news here. There are ways out of this but Tory politicians have little incentive with the short time horizons of an election looming. Damage limitation is the best they can work on now."
131,"It makes little difference whether the government wears a red badge, a blue badge or any other colour for that matter. Political ideology is all but dead. The markets confirmed that by killing off Truss and her version of Thatcherism. The result is that whoever is in power (for a long time to come)  economic decisions are guided by what markets have the stomach for. The result right now is that Rishi Sunak has neither the power or the time to make any significant changes other than calming markets. Taxes are at their highest in 70 years and taxing the middle classes, their pensions, investments or otherwise is politically now a no-go area. Perhaps applying temporary windfall taxes to the energy companies and the banks will help in the short term. Labour would, quite rightly, have a go at corporate tax dodgers  but none of this will produce the types of long-term revenue required to engage in an ideology. Socialism, the type that Corbyn was proposing (that caused a swing to the political right), has never worked, nor has extreme neoliberal capitalism, trickle-down economics or even Brexit. The left and right wings of political ideology are now dead in the water. It is because of these failed attempts that the state of the nations financial health is where it is. There is, effectively, no fiscal bandwidth left. Whichever way you look at it though, economic growth is what really counts. If the economy stagnates, so do living standards. It really is that simple. There are things that can be done to stimulate growth  but they all take time. Trussonomics is the biggest indicator to politicians that the markets are now in control  because the tipping point in just every facet of borrowing or financial speculation has been reached. As said, there is no bandwidth. Decarbonisation, innovation, trade, education and public health are all areas where we could see economic growth coming from  but a government destined to fail in the short-term will not invest for a long-term return. Being a winner in the global race to Net Zero and pushing on with our strategic advantage in science and technology are fundamental to growth. Making the most of Brexit in a rapidly changing world will take years but must be focused upon if Britain is to become anything that resembles a trading powerhouse. Having a plan for Brexit might help! A technical revolution in education and public health will drive economic improvement, not just in the workplace but help to level up regions. Seizing these opportunities would make us more competitive, more dynamic and most importantly future-focused. It was innovation and technology that drove the industrial revolution of 1760 to 1840. It brought about sweeping changes in economic and social organisation. But the reality of today is simple. Britain no longer has the technical advantages it had over its competition. But now Britain has another problem. Rishi Sunak is now this months version of a Tory Prime Minister on the ideological right and the Tories have proved something  they now lack the judgement needed when it comes to making decisions in the best interests of our country. And Sunak has an enviable CV when it comes to misjudgements. Sunak supported Camerons referendum that went on to crash the country into an economic wall in the guise of Brexit. He backed Boris Johnson who crashed himself into every wall possible. And in the midst of a deadly pandemic  Sunak subsidised people to dine out with no vaccine in sight causing a rapid incline in cases and no doubt many deaths with it. Sunak has said nothing about what to do about Brexit  the one major economic policy that is holding this country back. Lets be fair; politically he backed Johnson and worked next to him in a government that collapsed  twice. And just because Sunak understood the insanity of pushing unfunded tax cuts in a period of fiscal and current account deficits  with a looming recession, it is not proof of his ability to manage a country. After all, I predicted Brexit, the loss of several Tory PMs and a recession  it still doesnt qualify me for an advisory seat at the top table in No10. Rishi Sunak is in a government that has failed in everything it touches when it comes to the economy and general well-being of the country. Indeed, by many standards, everything is worse. And because everything is worse, investors are taking a dim view of the future prospects of the United Kingdom. This is another reason why there is less financial bandwidth  because everything is at breaking point. Our currency and bond markets are teetering on the edge of a cliff. A single miss-step and mayhem is triggered. But economic activity comes from having more than just good management of the economic machinery. The NHS is not just in a crisis  its in an existential crisis. There are 7 million on waiting lists with 9 to 10 million expected by this time in 2024. Leading education organisations have written to the government warning of the looming education funding crisis. The leaders of 12 education bodies in England said school and college funding had been cut to the bone over the past decade and a real-terms cut in spending would be catastrophic. They are warning of reductions in teaching and support staff, larger class sizes, cuts to the curriculum and student support services. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said schools are already on their knees because they just dont have the requisite funding to do the job thats required. Whats going to happen is schools are going to have to narrow their timetable, narrow their range of subjects offer. Were looking at a huge decline in things like design and technology, and creative subjects In other words  to put in the words of the experts  There is a very real risk of a decline in educational standards. Investors with a long-term horizon dont look upon an unhealthy, uneducated population as the place where they can prosper  they go elsewhere. We have an ongoing housing crisis ( and whats the point in government if they cant even house their own people) and a social care crisis that is the ticking time bomb of the next two decades. On top of all this, to distract the government from its duty of care to its own country  Putins attack on Ukraine continues to undermine the global economy and the fracturing of world geopolitics and international relationships. All the while, Sunak is now in charge of a government in breakdown mode. Indeed, in many respects, Britain looks a lot like the political rot undermining America. This is a government that has wantonly and willfully attacked the institutions that support civil society. It has fully encouraged and engaged in a cynical culture war simply to gain votes and actively looked to divide the nation and its constituent parts. The centre-right think tank Onward published results of its latest poll findings and found, even to their horror, a home truth. One-third of all voters said they would never vote for the Conservatives again in their lifetime. Another 50 per cent would probably not vote Tory again. And if ever there was one statistic that says it all, it is this  since 2019, the average age of a Tory voter has lept by 14 years. No one dare say this but in little more than a decade there will be more people aged 65 than 18  and look at the damage these ageing voters have caused in the last ten years. Brexit is the root cause of political divisiveness and given the lack of rational argument for it  it was replaced by a cynical trashing of expert opinion in favour of an era long gone and delivered by those with no ethical or moral compass. This profound degeneration of standards in public life has seen the Tory party not just become ungovernable  it has to all intents and purposes already imploded. What the UK really needs is good people at the top with the national interest at heart. A banker that lit the touchpaper that crashed our financial system in the UK for personal gains, such as Sunak, should not be anywhere near the levers of power. This fact tells you everything you need to know about the system failure we are in right now. Sunak is no statesman  yesterdays wooden acceptance speech confirmed that. Sunak is no Lloyd George, Atlee or Thatcher and will be unable to control the many undisciplined factions within his own party. He has no real vision of what needs to be done for the future of Britain other than sidestepping economic traps. It is very sad to witness and then have to admit  Britain continues its downwards spiral towards insignificance. A once great nation, proud of its achievements and place in the world  now on its knees to a few traders in the FX and bond market. We are a sliver of our former self  made so much worse in the last decade by the feral activities of self-serving liars and charlatans who promised sunlit uplands and delivered nothing but division and decay. Sunak cannot possibly overcome these systemic problems  that will take years of good governance, an ability the Tory party lost a long time ago."
132,"Economically speaking, there is nothing positive on the horizon for Britain. There are no sunlit uplands as promised by our veritable so-called leaders. The economy is about to spiral out of control. Britain is not about to suddenly find the economic holy grail of policy-making just because yet another Tory hopeful has a stab at stemming the failures of her predecessors. Theyve tried. Theyve failed. Indeed, even Thatchers neoliberal drive, which did work, now doesnt. You only have to look at the privatization of water to see that failure dramatically spewing its ideology all over Britains beaches. There is no new industrial revolution or a 21st-century equivalent of it for Britain. We wont find a new energy source that will revolutionise the world or invent a new technical advantage over all others as we have done in our historical past. Thats the problem with technology  everyone catches up so quickly. Liz Truss will do the same as the three previous Tory Prime Ministers. She will fail. And when she does, like the last three efforts  we will all have to pay. So what now for the economy? Truss is going for broke  literally. She thinks that her policies are somehow untried (by three decades of the last four in Tory hands) anywhere in the Western world  when, in fact, they have. Strangely enough, America is the biggest example of deregulation  but as Joe Biden announced yesterday  trickle down economics, which is exactly what Truss is about to hype up  has failed. So, in a country where we have a national debt equivalent to 100 per cent of GDP  facing an energy inflation spike that wont easily go away and a more general cost of living crisis that will quickly erode living standards, what will Truss do? Lowering taxes for the poor by 63 pence wont do it. Lowering taxes for the wealthy wont do it. Lowering taxes on corporations wont either (because trickle-down theory is now a known failure). My guess is she will go for broke. She will attempt to become a low-tax champion. And in the type of economy we have right now  balanced on the edge of a recession, with record high employment (meaning little bandwidth to increase output), she will spook the money markets. Targeting the housing market i.e. yet more intervention into a so-called free market to distort reality will not work. In normal markets, eliminating stamp duty will overheat house prices in the short-term. Eventually they will slow or correct in the medium term. But will it really do anything this time? It could if several million properties suddenly came to market  but thats not possible. And while house prices have defied the principles of economic gravity over the last few years, they simply cant keep going because theres only one trajectory right now  an inevitable increase of base rate interest rates. In other words, mortage payments will start increasing  quickly. Activity in the housing market will over-compensate and all but stop. So what else will kick start the economy? Not much is the answer. The reason is money. You need lots of it to invest in projects that actually do give you an edge. Education? Every year, the OECD releases its results on the global rankings of students in maths, reading and science across 72 countries. It shows the UK failing to come in the top ten in any of the three categories. Performing consistently well across the board, however, are several Asian countries, notably Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea. European countries such as Switzerland, Ireland, Finland and Estonia also stand out. The problem with education is that it takes years to see real results  and politics is very short-termism at best. In reality  Britain has failed to keep up because of political ideology. And education is just one example of the many problems that represent the incremental decline of Britain. Ideological Extremists Those on the hard-right of the economic spectrum have all but guaranteed more failure. Today, thats called neoliberal capitalism. It is the same with the fantasies of those on the far left of socialism. Theres never enough money. Both have to be kept in check by affordability  or you go bankrupt. Liz Truss and her new Chancellor are about to make some big economic wrong-turns. The money markets will quickly turn against them. The cost of borrowing for the government, businesses and for homeowners with mortgages will quickly head north. This, in turn, will push more inflation into the economy  which will push the value of the pound Sterling downward  that in turn  will push inflation up again. Its a financial death spiral  and it takes huge financial intervention to stop it once that trajectory takes hold. We dont hold US dollar reserves to fight back. We dont have gold reserves to sell and raise capital. The bond markets will lose confidence. What then?"
133,"Jacob Rees-Mogg is now the man in charge of our hard-won workers rights as the secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy. The UKs last two prime ministers, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, both promised that Brexit would not weaken employment rights and that EU-derived protections would be retained or replaced by something even better. Reportedly, though, Liz Truss does not feel bound by the same promise and appears to have brought in arch-Brexiteer Rees-Mogg to shred these rights. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has called for the government to come clean over its plans. So what hints can we get from Rees-Moggs own words about workers rights over the years? 1. An end to EU rights to time off? In 2016, Channel 4s Jon Snow asked Rees-Mogg if he supported keeping the following EU-derived employment rights listed by the TUCs Nicola Smith: Paid holiday, paid rest breaks, rights for time off if youve got kids and your kids are unwell, protection from discrimination when youre pregnant. Rees-Mogg replied: I dont support all these employment rights that come from Europe. 2. Sacking striking workers? In 2011, Rees-Mogg called on the government to sack striking border officials, imitating the robust action of the late US president Ronald Reagan in relation to recalcitrant air traffic controllers. In the notorious incident in 1981, Reagan sacked 11,359 striking workers and banned them from ever working for the government again. In Britain, workers have been protected from being sacked for lawful striking since 1871, and Moggs suggestion was so extreme it drew chuckles and groans and was ignored by Cameron. Truss threatened to impose minimum standards agreements that would hinder unions rights to lawful strikes during her leadership campaign, but even she hasnt suggested sacking workers who exercise their right to strike  yet. 3. Longer working weeks? Rees-Mogg complained in 2016 that Europe had effectively duped Britain into abiding by the Working Time Directive (which guarantees paid time off and stops workers being forced to work more than 48 hours a week). Calling the EU a failed state, he said that the European Court of Justice had interpreted the [EU] treaties to mean completely different things from what we believed we had signed up to, so, for example, the Working Time Directive came in under health and safety laws even when we had an opt-out from the social chapter [the part of EU treaty law that protects employment and other social rights]. Rees-Mogg had previously told parliament that he thought it was remarkable that the UN human rights convention covered paid time off, saying It is hard to believe that the right to paid holiday is an absolute moral right. 4. A lower minimum wage  or none at all? As a member of the red-wall-courting Johnson government, Rees-Mogg occasionally defended the minimum wage. But as a backbencher, he opposed its increase and even its existence. In 2012, he coyly said: Mr Deputy Speaker, you will rule me out of order if I argue that raising the minimum wage would be extremely unwise, so I would not dare to say it. Writing in the Telegraph in 2014, he said the government should not raise the minimum wage  then £6.31 an hour  because that would lead either to inflation or to unemployment. Rather than setting any minimum wage at all, he said the government should permit the free market to set wages. 5. More zero-hours contracts? In 2013 he decried lefties seeking to ban zero-hours contracts, saying it was useful for business to have access to a pool of people who could be called into work at short notice but are not guaranteed a specific level of employment, adding that while workers with other obligations could say no sometimes, naturally, they cannot refuse too often. Such contracts, he argued, benefit business, consumers and taxpayers by keeping costs down and they boost productivity allowing the efficient use of labour, as well as offering a route into employment. 6. More two-tier workforces with exploited, rights-free agency staff? In May this year, Jacob Rees-Mogg picked the nine most interesting ideas for Brexit benefits to pursue, from 2,000 suggestions from the British public, including scrapping equal rights for agency workers, along with niche issues such as allowing more powerful vacuum cleaners and electric bikes. The pick  which could see agency workers losing basic rights like paid holiday, for example  was not a surprise. In the 2016 Channel 4 interview mentioned above, Rees-Mogg had singled out EU protections for agency workers as very unhelpful and among elements that I would change. 7. Lower pay for the regions and fewer bargaining rights for unions? Teachers and NHS staff have, for decades, had their pay set nationally, meaning poorer areas can attract staff and unions have power to negotiate for large numbers. But in 2012 Jacob Rees-Mogg called not just for a huge extension of local pay (that is, lower pay in some regions) but also small, isolated negotiations in every workplace: I urge Her Majestys government to go much further and to abolish national pay bargaining altogether [and] we need to go much further so that every school and every hospital decides the pay rates that it will give its employees. Truss appeared to suggest  then quickly back away from  a policy of lower regional pay during her leadership campaign, but even she hasnt suggested setting it at such a micro level (yet). 8. More graft for workers? In August, Rees-Mogg backed Liz Trusss leaked comments that British workers needed more graft, telling the Mail on Sunday that her remarks were sensible and reflected an unfortunate reality. 9. More rights for bosses? In February 2022, Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Times that the government needed to reform employment rights as the power had shifted too far to employees. A flexible labour market is essential to our economic prosperity have we got that right? Well, we must of course look at that and see who needs protection and who doesnt Sometimes the employer would think they need more protection from the employee. 10. Fewer employment and welfare rights in general? In an introduction to a series of essays published by right-wing think tank Politeia in 2012, Rees Mogg said that: Deregulation is part of [his vision of Conservatism], especially in employment law. If society is wrapped in cotton wool, it will never prosper. Naturally, there needs to be some safety net for those who fail but unless some are allowed to fall none will be able to climb. 11. Paternalism in place of rights? Jacob Rees-Mogg is fond of citing the merits of the Victorian factory owners. He told MPs that in the Victorian age most employers were benevolent, kindly, good and not out of a Dickens novel: they were more Trollope than Dickens by and large. And in a 2012 debate on slavery and child labour in supply chains, he expressed doubts that the bill achieved its desired objectives, supporting some regulation but suggesting that it could be minimised by starting with conscience and the fact that companies that fail to follow the basics of humanity will be embarrassed in their marketing. They will be brought to shame in front of the nation."
135,"Looking at the headlines in the print media recently and youd be forgiven for thinking the country was in an unstoppable downward economic spiral. Perhaps it is. For instance, retail sales fell sharply in August and continue to do so as UK consumers struggle with soaring prices and high energy costs. This has actually been happening since mid summer. The reality is that retail sales are now shrinking. It is speeding up the approach of a recession and is piling even more pressure on a dejected pound. One very expected outcome is that the UK jobs market is now on course to lose some steam, which is driven by firms cutting levels of staff in response to their own increasing costs and weaker consumer spending, a new survey revealed. Even with Prime Minister Liz Trusss decision to freeze household energy bills at (an average) £2,500 for two years at a cost of £150bn  inflation still breached double digits, albeit it will likely reduce the severity of the depth of the coming recession. Real wages have not kept up. It doesnt help that the latest data from HMRC has seen Brexit deliver a devastating blow to business. The number of UK businesses exporting goods to the EU fell 33 per cent to 18,357 in 2021, from 27,321 in 2020. Exactly one-third of businesses exporting to the EU have given up. This has caused the UKs trade performance this year to fall to its worst level since records began in 1955. And the cause, according to analysts  is all down to Brexit. To top this  Sterling fell in value against the USD to its lowest level since 1985, bounced and fell back again  after yet another round of weaker than expected data on UK retail sales, which amplified concerns that the country is headed for a prolonged recession. I reported six months ago that by the start of the last quarter, Britain would be in recession, irrespective of whether it was technical or not. Olivia Cross, economist at Capital Economics, said the figures suggest that the downward momentum is gathering speed and supported her view that the economy is already in recession. There are multiple reasons why Britain is doing worse than its peers. The recent falls of educational standards (in comparison to peer nations) is up there. Privatisation of critical infrastructure has been a disaster. Water is a prime example  so is energy. The former is polluting just about everything to such an extent that tourism is being affected. This is hardly surprising with headlines from across the Atlantic such as  Sewage-covered beaches risk turning England into the dirty man of Europe Just a few weeks ago, it was reported that the very lovely Lake Windemere had become so polluted the water was as toxic as Cobra venom and posed a serious health risk. Regarding energy, the UK was paying the second highest amount for its electricity supply in the whole of Europe, topped only by the Czech Republic just two months ago. Since then, wholesale energy prices have fallen back somewhat  according to the Household Energy Price Index (HEPI). And yet, prices have not fallen for the consumer. The system is broken  obviously. Then theres the growing public health crisis. Just prior to the pandemic, UK healthcare was already on the slide. Generally recognised by most standards as being inside the top three best-performing systems in the world in 2010, it has now moved ten places down the ranks to 13th. This is a rapid decline by any standards. Poor handling of the pandemic and underfunding in the NHS has left hundreds of thousands of workers unable to work. Hidden Crisis Then theres the hidden crisis. Last year the top-earning 3 per cent of UK households each took home about £84,000 after tax. This puts Britains highest earners comfortably among the global elite. But as the Financial Times has recently reported on the same subject  While the top earners rank fifth, the average household ranks 12th and the poorest 5 per cent rank 15th. Far from simply losing touch with their western European peers, last year the lowest-earning bracket of British households had a standard of living that was 20 per cent weaker than their counterparts in Slovenia. Fifteen years ago, the average UK household was 8 per cent worse off than its peers in north-western Europe. But now things are so much worse as that income deficit has since rocketed to a record 20 per cent. This means that on the current trajectory, the average Slovenian household will be better off than its British counterpart by 2024. Not only that, but the average Polish family will move ahead before the end of the decade. Think about that for a moment. Low paid British workers could be going to Slovenia or Poland to better their lives than staying in the UK. Britain also did much worse than the Americans. Five years of pre-pandemic economic growth in US saw living standards basically lift all boats. Again, the data shows that this trend was totally absent in the UK. If this trajectory continues, the growing middle classes will continue to be eviscerated, the poor will get poorer  but there will be many more of them  and the rich will grow richer. This is a toxic cocktail that always ends badly. Governance Of course, all of these poor outcomes (pre or post-pandemic) are the result of nothing other than poor economic management. The Tory party has fully demonstrated in the twelve years it has been in power that it is now hopelessly out of depth. Drowning Street seems an accurate description of the problems being created in No 10 and No11. The growing health crisis will continue to grow and many other services will decline as treasury revenues fall against soaring borrowing. One in five of Britains population now lives in relative poverty. As The Times reports today  Real wages continue to fall despite the UKs unemployment rate dropping to its lowest level since 1974, official figures reveal today. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows sharply rising inflation outpaced wage growth, leading to a decrease in real total pay of 2.4 per cent year-on-year in the three months to August. Household debt is soaring. Homelessness, the ultimate indicator of political and economic failure, is on the rise. The number of actual homeless people is up 17 per cent against pre-pandemic measurements  and the number of social tenants becoming homeless has doubled. The present government will not be able to stop a recession or a lengthy period of stagnation (at best) and declining living standards for the vast majority of households for a considerable period of time. As recession tightens its grip, investors look elsewhere; the pound falls further  the feeling grows that youre in an economic death spiral. And so it will be. Next year will not be a happy one."
137,"Theyve backed the currency into a corner. Whilst a crashing Pound can be good for equities (as about three-quarters of the FTSE are in international markets), its not good for much else. Even those that crow on about exports being easier forget that 70 per cent of raw materials used in exports have to be imported first. The lesson about free markets and Brexit to stimulate growth are on show and will be painful to watch. The Bank of England is attempting to stem rising inflation  the government is going for growth  which leads to inflation. The Pound now sits at an all-time low. And whilst many other currencies around the world are suffering from a strong US Dollar  few countries shot themselves in the foot (like Brexit and borrowing) to make matters worse. Interest rates will go up, inflation will go up and the economy will stagnate. Worse, a recession gains speed. Liz Truss is not actually well supported within the Tory party and public opinion is not on her side. The slump in the Pound is a message. Its situation was better than it is today when the dotcom crash happened, when 911 stopped the world  when the financial crisis threatened everything and when Brexit arrived. All of those events were not as bad as it is today. Today is the final straw that broke the camels back. Once again, the party that has dominated this country for nearly 13 years have to admit  theyve failed  and failed big time. The Tory party has proved beyond doubt that it is not a One Nation party. The same can be said that it is not a party of fiscal responsibility. It cares little about the multiple crises burning at the heels of society. Public health, education, social care, security  you name it, nothing is better after 13 years. They blamed everything from immigrants to experts and now both are needed more than ever. As I wrote last week  this is the economic Brexit that leading right-wing Tories and their political commentators demanded. This is what the right-wing press, such as the Daily Mail, Express and The Sun shouted loudest about. This is what the grey vote was about  a rebuke to the future and our younger generations. Its here and its real. Brexit has caused economic activity to fall by around 4 per cent of GDP. It has caused relationships with our trading partners to become terribly strained. The so-called special relationship with the USA has imploded and the Union of Britain has created even greater tensions than ever before. Now that the Pound has crashed, investors are seeking new grounds making our future prospects even more grim. The cost of living crisis now looks like it will only get worse as the government loses control of the economy. The Tory party, its ideology and its Brexit have been mugged by the reality of the markets and overall sentiment about Britains long-term outlook. Its grim. Theres no good news here. There are ways out of this but Tory politicians have little incentive with the short time horizons of an election looming. Damage limitation is the best they can work on now."
138,"We have all heard about the ever-increasing and widespread use of foodbank across the UK. Take, for instance, the Trussell Trust. It has seen a staggering increase in the number of food parcels distributed over the last five years. They provided more than 2.1 million emergency food parcels between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022. Of these, 832,000 were for children. This represents an 81% increase compared to the same period five years ago. The Trussell Trust supports a nationwide network of more than 1,300 food bank centres. But now shoppers, those not using foodbanks are struggling too. Iceland boss, Richard Walker, claimed customers feeling the pinch of inflation are telling Iceland checkout staff to stop when they hit £40 before putting the rest of their shop back on the shelves. The cost of living crisis has seen the prices of everyday essentials soar, with the price of a loaf of bread increasing from 89p to £1.10 and milk prices increasing quite dramatically. The news comes as Rishi Sunak announced his cost of living support package. Walker commended the package saying Sunak had stepped up and pulled all the right levers despite one North East foodbank saying that the Chancellors support package was not enough. Everyones feeling the pinch but certainly the harder-pressed communities are feeling it more, Icelands managing director Richard Walker said to Sky News Generally, I think it is safe to say everyone is feeling the pinch now, it doesnt matter who you are. We do serve some of the poorer demographics around the country. We are hearing stories of some of our customs disappearing to food banks. The reality is there is no typical Iceland shopper, averages dont work very well because we have people who come in and spend five quid and people who come in and spend £50. The news comes after Asda chairman, Lord Stuart Rose, said the governments £15 billion cost of living handout is not enough to help struggling familiar and is only a drop in the ocean compared with the pressures consumers are facing. Rose claimed Asda was spending £90 million attempting to keep prices low for its shoppers."

140,"Things are about to get worse with the cost of living crisis, which is primarily being driven by energy costs. Brent crude, the international benchmark, hit $120.50 a barrel, up 1 per cent ahead of the July contracts expiry on Tuesday. The fall back in the price was temporary and is now the highest price for the last two months. This means petrol and diesel prices are likely to move up even higher than they already are in the UK and reach new record prices. As the summer months get underway, demand for petrol and diesel ramps up for the holiday season  and projections so far see no reductions against pre-pandemic years. Lingering concerns over supplies from Russia have not helped. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose by a similar amount to more than $116 a barrel. The rally in crude oil comes as supplies of refined products, such as gasoline, remain tight at major delivery hubs at a time when demand is expected to pick up steam in many countries, including the US The gas oil contract in Europe, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, is trading close to record levels near $1,200 a tonne. Motorists in many countries are now paying record prices at the pumps for diesel and petrol despite crude being well below its all-time high of $147.50 a barrel, which it hit in 2008. Lower exports of diesel from Russia, have tightened markets even more so than crude. The Opec+ group have not responded to these price hikes and has refused to accelerate oil production increases. The group meets this Thursday and is widely expected to stick with its plan of raising production by about 400,000 barrels a month, a target that has been in place since last year. Under these pressures, plus the Russia/Ukraine war, inflation more widely  petrol and diesel prices do not look like they will retreat any time soon."
142,"Almost 90,000 people in England have fallen behind on costly social care payments as the cost of living crisis deepens, and hundreds now face action from aggressive debt recovery agencies, openDemocracy reveals. Of the 87,421 adult social care users known to have missed at least one payment, 60,248 have been issued with a reminder or a warning notice. This latter figure equates to a quarter of all chargeable adult social care users, which includes those who are elderly or have a disability, across the 78 English councils that responded to openDemocracys Freedom of Information request. The real figure is likely to be even higher, as 73 councils with responsibility for adult care either failed to respond or did not respond in full Twenty of the councils that responded to the FOI request have referred a total of 632 current adult care users to debt collection agencies. A further 59 councils have launched court proceedings to recover care debt on 830 occasions over the past three years, though not all were against living care users. Some would have been against the estates of deceased clients, for example. Its immoral. We should be thinking about how we improve the lives of disabled people, not how we limit them The findings come as concern grows over care charges. Campaigners are now calling for local authorities to follow the lead of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which abolished fees for at-home care in 2015. There is a link between mental ill-health, mental health impairments, and debt, Helen Rowlands, a co-founder of Cheshire Disabled People Against Cuts, told openDemocracy. We know from the conversations we have with advocacy workers within disabled peoples organisations across England that those problems are intensifying. And we also know that social care charging is a key factor within that. A postcode lottery In England, adults receiving council-funded social care must pay towards the costs, with contributions based on income and savings. Councils cannot impose charges so high that an individuals income falls below the national minimum income guarantee, which rose by 3% last month after being frozen since 2016. But there is still a postcode lottery, with the type and level of care offered  and at what cost  differing between local authorities. Nearly half of Liverpools 3,649 current chargeable care users have been issued with a reminder over late payments. The council did not make any referrals to debt collectors or start court proceedings, which a spokesperson explained as a compassionate approach on account of the pandemic. In West Sussex, 59% of the 4,644 chargeable adult social care users have been issued reminders. The council hasnt used debt collectors but has initiated four court cases in the past three years. Birmingham City Council, which did not respond to openDemocracys FOI request, made more than 3,500 referrals of social care users to debt-collecting agencies in 2020-21, down from 4,499 the year before. Concerns over care charges were raised in February, when the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman upheld a complaint against Essex County Council for repeatedly invoicing a woman for thousands of pounds she didnt owe. The woman, who had a history of depression, paid the council £3,300 before killing herself. Though the ombudsman said it was not possible to determine whether the persistent invoices had contributed to her death, they found the requests for payment had caused unnecessary distress. Permanently in debt Local authorities can raid part of an individuals disability benefit payments to contribute towards their care costs  leaving people with little income. This was the case with Nick*, who has severe learning difficulties. Due to a reassessment of his needs that coincided with West Sussex Council scrapping its previous cap on care charges, Nicks care bills rose by 175% last year  eating up much of his disability benefits. Its immoral. We should be thinking about how we improve the lives of disabled people, not how we limit them, said Melanie*, Nicks live-in carer. And by cutting back their money, it limits them hugely. A spokesperson for West Sussex Council said care charges were based on national guidance, and had increased from January 2021 after a decision was taken to apply the minimum statutory rate for people of working age, as advised by the Department of Health and Social Care, for the amount of income someone must be left with for day-to-day living. But Melanie disagrees that the amount Nick has been left with is enough to live a normal, happy life. He doesnt have money now to do things that we would do, she said. He cant go have a takeaway with his mates. We are permanently trapped financially on the bare minimum and permanently struggling financially The fear of losing disability benefits puts some people off from applying for adult care support. Janet, who has depression and anxiety, is the sole carer for her husband, Keith, who has uncontrolled epilepsy, a deformed arm, mild learning difficulties and partial sight. They have asked openDemocracy to withhold their surnames. Janet has to help Keith with all personal care needs, including dressing and using the toilet, and keep him safe during his seizures. She would like to get adult care funding from their local council to pay for an assistant, which would allow them to be more independent and live a more normal life  but the council would likely take money from their benefits. We are permanently trapped financially on the bare minimum and permanently struggling financially  permanently in debt, Janet told openDemocracy. We dont have any help from the local authority because they would take part of the care component of [disability benefit] to pay towards it meaning we would be worse off than we are now. Campaigner Claire Glasman is a founder member of WinVisible, a community organisation representing women with visible and invisible disabilities. She said care charges were a form of violence against women. Those of us with high needs get the highest charges, including women of colour already hit by health inequality, she said. Women who drop out [of care] live in squalor or are forced to rely on acquaintances or men who often become abusive, shortening our lives. Referring to the high proportion of people who are behind on care charge payments, a spokesperson for Liverpool City Council said: Work has now started to improve this situation, including planning the introduction of direct debits as a payment method. Were confident that this will see a return to a normal level of arrears."

Some would have been against the estates of deceased clients, for example. Its immoral. We should be thinking about how we improve the lives of disabled people, not how we limit them The findings come as concern grows over care charges. Campaigners are now calling for local authorities to follow the lead of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, which abolished fees for at-home care in 2015. There is a link between mental ill-health, mental health impairments, and debt, Helen Rowlands, a co-founder of Cheshire Disabled People Against Cuts, told openDemocracy. We know from the conversations we have with advocacy workers within disabled peoples organisations across England that those problems are intensifying. And we also know that social care charging is a key factor within that. A postcode lottery In England, adults receiving council-funded social care must pay towards the costs, with contributions based on income and savings. Councils cannot impose charges so high that an individuals income falls below the national minimum income guarantee, which rose by 3% last month after being frozen since 2016. But there is still a postcode lottery, with the type and level of care offered  and at what cost  differing between local authorities. Nearly half of Liverpools 3,649 current chargeable care users have been issued with a reminder over late payments. The council did not make any referrals to debt collectors or start court proceedings, which a spokesperson explained as a compassionate approach on account of the pandemic. In West Sussex, 59% of the 4,644 chargeable adult social care users have been issued reminders. The council hasnt used debt collectors but has initiated four court cases in the past three years. Birmingham City Council, which did not respond to openDemocracys FOI request, made more than 3,500 referrals of social care users to debt-collecting agencies in 2020-21, down from 4,499 the year before. Concerns over care charges were raised in February, when the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman upheld a complaint against Essex County Council for repeatedly invoicing a woman for thousands of pounds she didnt owe. The woman, who had a history of depression, paid the council £3,300 before killing herself. Though the ombudsman said it was not possible to determine whether the persistent invoices had contributed to her death, they found the requests for payment had caused unnecessary distress. Permanently in debt Local authorities can raid part of an individuals disability benefit payments to contribute towards their care costs  leaving people with little income. This was the case with Nick*, who has severe learning difficulties. Due to a reassessment of his needs that coincided with West Sussex Council scrapping its previous cap on care charges, Nicks care bills rose by 175% last year  eating up much of his disability benefits. Its immoral. We should be thinking about how we improve the lives of disabled people, not how we limit them, said Melanie*, Nicks live-in carer. And by cutting back their money, it limits them hugely. A spokesperson for West Sussex Council said care charges were based on national guidance, and had increased from January 2021 after a decision was taken to apply the minimum statutory rate for people of working age, as advised by the Department of Health and Social Care, for the amount of income someone must be left with for day-to-day living. But Melanie disagrees that the amount Nick has been left with is enough to live a normal, happy life. He doesnt have money now to do things that we would do, she said. He cant go have a takeaway with his mates. We are permanently trapped financially on the bare minimum and permanently struggling financially The fear of losing disability benefits puts some people off from applying for adult care support. Janet, who has depression and anxiety, is the sole carer for her husband, Keith, who has uncontrolled epilepsy, a deformed arm, mild learning difficulties and partial sight. They have asked openDemocracy to withhold their surnames. Janet has to help Keith with all personal care needs, including dressing and using the toilet, and keep him safe during his seizures. She would like to get adult care funding from their local council to pay for an assistant, which would allow them to be more independent and live a more normal life  but the council would likely take money from their benefits. We are permanently trapped financially on the bare minimum and permanently struggling financially  permanently in debt, Janet told openDemocracy. We dont have any help from the local authority because they would take part of the care component of [disability benefit] to pay towards it meaning we would be worse off than we are now. Campaigner Claire Glasman is a founder member of WinVisible, a community organisation representing women with visible and invisible disabilities. She said care charges were a form of violence against women. Those of us with high needs get the highest charges, including women of colour already hit by health inequality, she said. Women who drop out [of care] live in squalor or are forced to rely on acquaintances or men who often become abusive, shortening our lives. Referring to the high proportion of people who are behind on care charge payments, a spokesperson for Liverpool City Council said: Work has now started to improve this situation, including planning the introduction of direct debits as a payment method. Were confident that this will see a return to a normal level of arrears."
151,"Im not a seasoned investor or a financial advisor. I dont consider myself an expert in anything much and all of what you read here, is merely my opinion. However, I did put a big bet on Brexit even though Im a remainer, I did predict the loss of several Tory PMs as a result and that the promised sunlit uplands would never come. Months ago, before the analysts and economists were forecasting a recession, I not only predicted that but went a step further and boldly forecasted stagflation for 2023. I have consistently warned that worse is to come. I have put my money where my mouth is. I have steered clear of stocks/shares of any class for 2022 and even sidestepped traditional safe havens such as bonds. For me, we are witnessing in real-time a new era. There is nothing cyclical about what is unfolding. The global Fear and Greed Index sits at 12 and is well entrenched in the category of extreme fear. Only one month ago and for the previous 12 months  investors were happily sat at 41  just a bit fearful. Not now. Stocks, options, safe havens and bonds  have all entered extreme fear territory all at the same time. The fear factor really is a thing. Look around you right now. The age-old advice of a 60/40 equities to bonds portfolio is haemorrhaging value. Quality growth stocks have taken a nosedive as have just about all the indexes you can find. The highly regarded Vanguard Global Corporate Bond Index is down over 12 per cent year to date. The MSCI World Index has done just as badly  down 13 per cent. The FTSE is now the same value as it was in 2017. The FT reports today that  no amount of fretting about market crashes and looming recessions can allow central banks to even begin to look like they arent fully focused on having a go (however fruitless it may be) at bringing it back under control. So here we are  in what Andrew Lapthorne, Société Générales head of quantitative equity research, calls the unusual position of seeing equity and bond markets imploding at the same time: between them, they have lost some $23tn of value since their peak last year. Thats a lot of losses. Many analysts are now forecasting that inflation is almost at its peak, having not forecasted inflation to be more than 5 per cent (just a few months ago)  and even then in only a transitory short period (ha!). The thing is this. Even if inflation did start to retreat, it wont get back to the Bank of England target of 2 per cent any time soon  certainly not next year. And even if inflation were to half, prices are still 5 per cent higher than they were a year before. Weve had an era. That 30-year era was of interest rates heading down, which meant controlling inflation was much easier. Now were about to enter an era of higher interest rates, which means the tools available are there, but much harder to use. Last year, much to the amusement of some, I predicted that things would get so bad that the entire Western world was about to enter this new era. My thinking was that globalisation had fractured under the pressures of the pandemic, that alliances would rapidly change, that governments would start hoarding to protect their economies and that the very dynamics of globalisation  itself deflationary in output  would fail. I also posited that there would be a rapid change of capital investment put towards fighting the climate crisis  and this meant an inflationary pressure over a much longer period. Russias attack on Ukraine has massively exacerbated this forecast. Last year, a dozen of the biggest fossil fuel polluters in the world put £100billion into clean energy resources as even they can see the writing on the wall. As weve reported today, Germany has an inflation figure for production at nearly 34 per cent. It might surprise you to know that even amongst the huge supplies of gas and oil being funnelled into Europe  last year, western oil companies found new oil and gas reserves of less than 5 per cent of usual global demand. This was a record low. That signals only one thing ahead of us all  inflation and higher prices on everything for the long road ahead. The indicators for a turnaround are not there. The Western world has an ageing population, and this is a demographic who have never been wealthier, so they are not spending less. And contrary to many forecasts, computerisation and digitisation has not brought us productivity gains over the last 40 years, because in real terms that has been falling, especially in the UK, USA and Europe. IN other words, the deflationary gains made by the modern world and globalisation have been made and cant get lower. There is only one direction. Two weeks ago  Andy Haldane, who is now a government adviser, said that inflation had surpassed my worst expectations  and that higher interest rates could stick around for years as well. And its not just that I think the level of inflation is high, Im slightly fearful it might stick around for some while as well. This wont come and go in a matter of months. I think this could be years rather than months. Haldane also warned that the rises now anticipated would hit a generation of mortgage holders who have become accustomed to lower interest rates. For me, the expectation now for the rest of this decade is volatility and inflation. So, what has performed well in times like these? The five big asset classes are generally seen (for us in the UK) as being US stocks, UK FTSE, UK bonds, Gold and Property. Since 1988 only one asset class has never entered negative territory  property. Gold always performs well. Weve already seen that UK bonds as a traditional safe haven is on a losing path. So that is where I am  invested in property and gold  and Im sitting there, quite probably for quite a while. Property is quite likely going to hit zero or possibly a minus point or two in the next year or two but it generates inflation-linked income. Gold is exactly what it is  a counterbalance to the fear factor and theres an awful lot of that about right now."
152,"Stagflation is the worst of all worlds to a normal working household. It is seen when slowing or negative growth and high unemployment coincides with inflation. It eats away at discretionary spending first, then into household budgets for essentials whilst potentially threatening your livelihood. Stagflation is, as so many analysts now predict  something of a foregone conclusion for many countries around the world and the UK is very much included in those forecasts. The UK economy grew a paltry 0.1 per cent in February just as rising costs, surging energy bills and higher taxes piled on the pressure to reduce spending and investment. Growth was down sharply from the 0.8 per cent recorded in January. The UK is now in a slow economic spiral that will head towards a recession. Dont forget, the economy is still growing but from a low base  and the speed of that growth has dramatically slowed up. Inflation was 7 per cent in the year to March. It is expected to reach around 9 per cent at its peak  however, unemployment is low, at 3.8 per cent. From 2000 to 2021 the number of people in full-time work rose from 20.4mn of the working-age population to 24mn. After the bank-led financial crisis in 2008, just over one million people lost full-time jobs, which took six years to recover from. Whilst that crisis was a quick shock to the global economy, stagflation is a slow-burn affair. Analysts and economists opinion is, for the time being, divided on whether we have already entered stagflation, are on the verge of it, or could hit it in the future. But whenever it officially arrives  it will have serious consequences for your investments. I found this really informative chart from The Times/Sunday Times via Schroders. It is just about the only chart you need to see to give a great idea of where your investments should be at times of economic change. Imogen Tew is a senior money reporter for The Times and The Sunday Times, having joined from the Financial Times Group. Her advice is as follows: If you are a long-term investor with a diversified portfolio, you are not likely to need to make any big changes, or any changes at all, to your investments  part of the reason for creating a diversified portfolio is so you do not have to alter it when the investment landscape changes. A diversified portfolio will have exposure to assets such as bonds, cash, commodities and property as well as equities. It will also have a mix of the defensive stocks that are tipped to do well in a period of stagflation (such as energy and utilities) and other, more growth-oriented stocks, as well as a mixture of different bond types and investments from various countries. One thing to note from this chart is where the top performers are in times of economic strife. And as that is exactly where the economy is heading  real assets  as in tangible assets, is where investors go. Property and gold are the obvious choices  oil is another. Commodities (raw materials or primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee) have been returning handsomely at 18.1 per cent since 1988 during times of stagflation, according to Schroders. Gold has also done really well by returning 14.1 per cent and property or REITs (real estate investment trusts) around 9.5 per cent. If you are well off enough to buy into property, the return on capital is one thing, the monthly income another and that is why buy-to-let is so popular. The other point to look at with this chart is when coming out of stagflation and entering a period of growth  commodities and property do just as well. Recession is another matter. So the question is  stagflation or recession?"
153,"The United Kingdom is heading towards an economic perfect storm  stagflation. It appears that economists are now only just accepting that this is far more likely than not. In six months time, Britain will also likely be facing a winter of discontent. I wrote several months ago in the European Financial Review  It is inevitable that both recession and inflation, commonly known as stagflation will hit Russia very hard. But the same stagflationary effects (on a less severe scale) will also affect Europe as a whole, as it will the USA. Both are energy-dependent on Russia. The former is a physical requirement, the latter is not in control of global pricing. As jobs get lost and inflation continues its northward trajectory, households will do the inevitable and tighten their belts in expectation of harder times. Interest rates will rise to combat inflation. This will result in banks tightening financial conditions  which will see businesses look at how to save cash and significantly reduce R&D. The effects of stagflation are awful  and dangerous. Today, it is largely accepted that stagflation in Britain is unlikely to be avoided. In The Economic Times, we have published reports on how Brexit is crushing business with a third of British exporters to the EU now out of business and that manufacturing growth is markedly slowing. The British art market, once the number two hot spot in the world has lost its place to Italy, France, Germany and China for the same reason. Weve reported on how global supply chains will continue to suffer well beyond this year and that inflation, and shrinkflation will hit households really hard. Household savings are plummeting, credit card debt has reached new records and well over one million households are to be pushed into poverty within a year. Today, The Times reports that  Deloittesquarterly survey of finance chiefs at some of the UKs biggest companies finds they are facing the toughest external challenges for eight years. Its gloomy findings are echoed by the rival accountant BDO, whose bi-monthly poll of 500 medium-sized businesses reveals that many are scrambling to raise cash to cope with rocketing costs. None of this bodes well. Confidence amongst consumers, manufacturers, exporters, growers and so on are all negative. Although the commentators and economists have not said so  a recession is coming, job losses are coming and inflation will continue to hit household purses. The result of all of this could easily be unrest. Already industrial disputes have rocketed  reaching their highest in five years, with Britains biggest trade unions taking on scores of employers to challenge wage and salary offers that lag behind inflation. And as previously reported, this is not just about what has happened in the last year  its stretches back all the way to the bank-led financial crisis. Over the past 12 months alone, the Trades Union Congress has recorded at least 300 disputes in different industries. Since 2008, Britain has seen wage stagnation on the one hand whilst corporate profits were soaring on the other. Allied with the more recent cost of living crisis  public anger is becoming more evident. In Britain, over the centuries, weve had events of public unrest over the price of things as obscure as theatre tickets, fish skins and even wrestling. Over the last 100 years, the majority of these events have been politically motivated. However, since 2015 the government have been cracking down on events of public unrest with many more severe penalties even for peaceful protest (including prison sentences). In fact, no significant events have taken place since 2017. But public anger is rising as quickly as discretionary household spending is being crushed by all the aforementioned pressures and the likelihood is that in the late summer and early winter, that anger could spill over. The Winter of Discontent was the period between November 1978 and February 1979, characterised by the battle between pay rises and inflation. But there was something else similar to today that was not well recorded. The unrest back then had other deeper causes besides anger over pay rises and inflation. The Labour party fought over its internal divisions and its commitment to socialism. It manifested in disputes over labour law reform and macroeconomic strategy during the 1960s and early 1970s and pitted constituency members against the partys establishment. We can see similar philosophical and economic policy struggles going on with Keir Starmers recent battleground of evicting Corbyn and his acolytes and his attempts to make the party electable. Back then in the 1970s, the result was that a political shift took place  instrumental to the victory of Margeret Thatcher in the general election after Labours James Callaghans government fell to a no-confidence vote. Public anger usually starts with physical events  such as the 2011 austerity cut protests or perhaps even the emerging cost of living crisis  which then rises as people feel more and more helpless to do anything about it. The fact that three-quarters of the public think the current Prime Minister is not trustworthy, and that almost as many think Rishi Sunak is a chancer, not a Chancellor is one thing. It is quite another that the Conservative party seem more self-interested through corruption and sleaze than genuinely helping those working households that are struggling, through no fault of their own. This is a recipe for more political and economic instability. And like Gordon Browns 10pence tax debacle of 2008, no one really thought much of it when announced, but only reacted when it hit them in the wallet. In the same year, The Spectator wrote: Looking back on the 10p tax debacle, the narrative becomes clear. It was Gordon Brown putting his ambition before the good of low-income earners. It was fiscal mismanagement on the largest scale. It was the moment Labour was wrenched from its roots. It was cynical, exploitative and needless. It was our Prime Minister at his very worst. The Conservative party has much to fear should the cost of living crisis turn into a winter of discontent. It could easily send them into a political void, with its ship sinking amid the shouts of said corruption and sleaze, especially with Boris Johnson at its helm."
154,"Air Source Heat Pumps are an increasingly popular way to heat up homes. They work equally well as the primary source of heat in the home or as a supplement to existing heating systems. They provide affordable heating all year round and a reliably constant source of hot water. Heat pumps are not just another form of heating. They are materially different from the standard methods we use to heat our homes. Most sources of heat rely on the generation of heat and its distribution around the property. However, heat pumps simply move existing heat into your home. Since they do not spend resources on creating heat, they are less expensive and more efficient than most comparable solutions. They are also a remarkably green solution for your heating needs. They produce more energy than they consume, and therefore, they reduce your energy bills and qualify you for energy-saving government grants. However, despite their many advantages, Air Source Heat Pumps are not a solution for everyone. Read on to see if these remarkable units are suitable for your needs. Air Source Heat Pump Cost Breakdown The system tends to cost more than its new gas or oil-fired central heating system equivalents. However, a sound heat pump system will more than make up for it by saving on energy bills. Keep in mind that because it does not generate energy independently, the air source heat pump produces more energy than it consumes electricity. Their overall efficiency can be three or four times higher than most other heating systems. Product Cost An air-source heat pump costs anywhere between £4,000-8,000 depending on the model and its output capacity. You may find yourself paying to improve the insulation of your home as well. Keep in mind that heat pumps are not particularly useful unless you have high-quality insulation. However, the systems are made by a variety of different companies, and their pricing schemes vary considerably. For example, a Mitsubishi unit costs between £2000 and £5000 without installation. Meanwhile, Daikin and Samsung units typically cost about £1000 less. The unit with the best reviews and reputation is the Nibe F2040. They are smart units integrated into your phone and immediately alert you if anything goes wrong. They also have the best specs in terms of energy savings and cut the bills immediately and dramatically. However, these cost a good deal more than the competition, fetching £7000 without figuring in installation. Installation Cost The installation of an air source heat pump costs £1,000-2,000. Therefore, the process will likely cost you £5,000-£10,000 at the end of the day. However, if you install ground source heat pumps, the system will cost significantly more. The process requires installing pipes beneath the ground and may cost somewhere between £11,000 and £15,000. What Impacts the installation Cost Price The main factors contractors will take into account when giving you a quote on Air Source Heat Pump system will include, but are not limited to: The size of the home The degree of insulation in the home The pump size you require The brand of the pump and unit The pumps performance specs Your desired room temperature Aside from the installation itself, other factors will affect your financial outlay. The installation of an Air Source Heat Pump system often requires the overall upgrade of other elements in your home, such as the insulation and existing heating infrastructure. For example, if your home heating is based on electrical storage heaters, you may need to install new pipes and radiators throughout your home. If your home has a central heating system, the overhaul will be less drastic. However, you may still want to upgrade to larger radiators and install underfloor heating. As a general rule of the thumb, the older your home and heating infrastructure are, the more expensive this system is to install. It is often less expensive to install an Air Source Heat Pump system in a house that is being newly built than an existing one. This is especially relevant for ground source heat pumps, which require digging and are easier to put in with the foundations than later. Therefore, a good proportion of newly built homes are fitted for Air Source Heat Pump systems. The size of your home and its layout will also have a significant impact on the price. The installation for a detached house is estimated at £8000 to £16000. Meanwhile, installation in a terraced unit or semi-detached house can cost £7000 to £10000. The process is most affordable in a flat and should run about £6000 to £8000. How Do Air Source Heat Pumps Work? Air Source Heat Pumps are kind of amazing. They take the air blowing outside, no matter how cold it may be, and transform it into hot air that is then transmitted around the home. In the process, they produce about three times as much energy as they consume. The secret is in its use of energy that already exists in the environment instead of creating its own. External air is blown through a system of tubes. The system fills the air with a refrigerant, which helps transform it from liquid to gas. The gas undergoes compression, which adds heat as it passes through a heat exchanger. The exchanger is surrounded by cool air, which turns warm and is then circulated around the home. In the meantime, the refrigerant returns to its cool liquid state and restarts the process, heating the entire property in the process. There are two types of pumps. One is an air-to-water system, which relies on radiators or an underfloor heating system. In another variation, they can heat water through a storage tank. The second is the air-to-air systems, which typically use fans to circulate air. Many people prefer the first system since the second variety cannot be used to heat water. The system uses electricity. However, it is still considered a renewable system. That is because the air running through the Air Source Heat Pumps is heated by the sun. Therefore, the system is environmentally friendly and recognized as such by the UK government for grant purposes. Pros & Cons Like any home heating system, Air Source Heat Pumps have advantages and disadvantages. There are significant advantages the system has over most comparable systems: It is a very efficient source of heat and hot water for most homes. If you use an Air Source Heat Pump with a renewable tariff, it will have no carbon imprint whatsoever. Saves on energy bills in the long term. It participates in the Renewable Heat Incentive program, and therefore, installation costs are offset by payments. The system is low-maintenance and typically lasts a long time without breaking down. The better Air Source Heat Pump Systems will also cool your home in the summer. The system is very safe as it does not introduce flammable or explosive materials. It is one of the safest heating systems out there. The system does not require gas pipes to work. Therefore, it is probably the best heating system for homes that cannot or prefer not to link up to the gas system. However, an Air Source Heat Pump system is not the right fit for every home. It has some significant downsides, including: The temperature emitted is lower than most conventional boilers  therefore, it could require investment in larger radiators and improved insulation. Need outdoor space and can be noisy. Expensive to install and works best with a water tank. Dont work as efficiently in extremely cold weather. When the temperature outside is less than 0°C, it does not operate at total efficiency or capacity. At below -20°C, the unit will not work correctly. Air Source Heat Pump systems require a good deal of space, comparable to a large air conditioner, which can be a problem for smaller flats and units. It can be particularly problematic if you have a small garden space which the equipment would curtail. It is a reasonably noisy installation, and if you live in a quiet environment, the sound can be noticeable. Can Air Source Heat Pumps Save You Money? The short answer is yes. Energy bills with Air Source Heat Pumps will inevitably be significantly lower because you do not have to spend any money on generating heat within the system. However, the exact amount of savings will vary from home to home, depending on size and insulation. However, users have reported saving anywhere over 25% on their heating bills and sometimes far more than water heating expenses. If we take a typical 4-room house as an example and compare the bills from other heating sources to those associated with Air Source Heat Pumps, we get the following results: If you are switching from an old gas boiler, you can save about £560£650 annually When switching from an old oil boiler, you may save about £930£1,100 annually If you switch from an old oil boiler, you can save about £1,365£1,610 annually. Remember that if you have a newer and more efficient version of any of these systems, you may be saving significantly less. However, an Air Source Heat Pump system is more efficient than any of these other systems, even at their highest level of performance. Air Source Heat Pumps will also save you money on service and replacements compared to most equivalents. They are notoriously reliable and usually last well over 20 years when properly maintained. However, to ensure that it is operating at the highest performance level, it should be serviced and examined every few years. One of the great things about the system is that you can perform a lot of the maintenance yourself, even if you are not DIY-minded. A lot of the attention the system requires is non-technical and straightforward. For example, you need to constantly make sure that a plentiful supply of air is available. You will have to check for leaves and rubbish and keep plants from growing near the unit. While a bit of a pain, all of this maintenance is free! Are There Grants Available? The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) grant covers Air Source Heat Pumps. To qualify, all you need is to conform to the following standards: Generate heat from a renewable source (such as Air Source Heat Pumps). Use your Air Source Heat Pumps system to serve a single household. This initiative was launched by the government to reduce UK carbon emissions and hit its renewable energy targets. Some heat pump system owners are set to receive £1,300 per year annually according to current standards. One of the best ways to use the RHI resources is by appropriating them to the upfront cost of installation. Many installers participate in the grant system and will help you reduce upfront costs by using it. What is the Bottom Line? We do not recommend using Air Source Heat Pumps as the primary heating source in older and less insulated homes. In those cases, it may struggle to keep the house as warm as you would like. Therefore, you may want to combine it as part of a hybrid system and integrate it with a conventional boiler in older and less energy-efficient homes. Another issue is the performance of Air Source Heat Pumps in freezing climates. If you live in a particularly frigid area, you may find yourself struggling to keep the home appropriately warm. Fortunately, the average UK winter temperature is in range of the best performance levels of these units. However, they will struggle in really tough winters. However, if your house is a modern and well-insulated home located in a temperate weather zone, an Air Source Heat Pump may be the right solution for you. It will save you a bundle of money, and you will be significantly contributing to a greener future by lowering your carbon footprint."
155,"More and more of us will start to wonder what will happen to property prices when interest rates keep rising. Theres a difference between being up to your eyes in mortgage debt to get onto the housing ladder and having a lengthy fixed rate mortgage you can now easily afford. Dinner tables around the country will see the property price discussion become far more frequent in future months as the issue becomes a hot topic. One-third of all homes in the UK are mortgage-free. The truth is that rising inflation will cause interest rates to follow. But rising inflation usually pushes up property prices in the medium term. In fact, over the last four decades property prices have risen about 400 per cent and that was with controlled inflationary pressures. The FT reports that  Considering double-digit property prices growth, you might think rising interest rates would take some heat out of the market. In a recent note, research group Capital Economics described property as the weak link as interest rates rise. Nevertheless, it predicted rates would have to get to around 4 per cent to trigger price falls unless quantitative tightening causes a greater economic wobble than expected (rising unemployment would spook mortgage lenders much more than rising interest rates). This analysis forgets one thing though. When the pandemic got itself into full swing and the government created the furlough scheme  savings rocketed. Then the government significantly reduced stamp duty for a limited period, which caused a buying spree of property not seen since before the 1988 property crash. In other words  transactions shot up, taking future sales away from the market. In the late 1980s and early 1990s  the big problem was that no one put their properties on the market because they couldnt find a replacement to move to. Today, the average estate agent has just 26 properties for sale  a drop of a fifth in the last year alone, with no sign of that fall slowing. Much of that is caused by property arriving on the market and selling much quicker. Danny Luke, from Quick Move Now, which provided national data sets for property listings said  As you can see from the figures, the number of properties coming to the market has fallen significantly in most areas, and nationally weve seen a fall of 21%. Luke went on to add  Every region of England and Wales has seen significant rises in the percentage of housing stock that is sold subject to contract. This demonstrates high demand for property, despite rising interest rates, rising property prices and significant increases in the cost of living. Many property experts predicted a stabilising of property prices or perhaps even a slight fall in prices in the first part of this year, but that price correction is yet to materialise, despite mounting external pressures. And those mounting pressures are mounting a lot quicker than many expected. Confidence in any market of value is key and many households are already tightening their belts in fear of disposable incomes vapourising in the face of rising costs of the basics  food and energy especially. The outlook for property prices is that they will cool to probably zero (inflation) by the time data becomes available at the end of the year (Q4) or the very beginning of next year."
156,"It was only last week when The Economic Times reported that  the Bank of England highlighted that UK consumers had borrowed a record amount in February, with many economists commenting it was a sign that the cost of living crisis was actually hitting wallets even before Putins invasion of Ukraine pushed energy prices higher. But now theres only one day to go before average energy prices zoom up by 54 per cent. Today, we are now seeing just how damaging the cost of living crisis is becoming  or more alarmingly  just how fast it is taking effect. Household savings in the UK are now being drained at the fastest rate for nearly ten years. The financial editor of The Times reports that  About 40 per cent of households built up their savings during lockdown but 60 per cent did not, according to the Scottish Widows Household Finance Index. It found that the amount of cash left for discretionary spending after living expenses has fallen by the sharpest amount since 2013. The measure of peoples perceptions of financial wellbeing fell to 38.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, its lowest since the start of the pandemic two years ago. A score of 50 per cent indicates no change on the previous quarter. The rising cost of living is now the biggest money concern of almost half of households according to Aldermore Banks latest savings tracker, which surveyed 4,000 UK adults. Households now face what many consider to be a perfect storm of financial strain -everything from National Insurance tax hikes alongside the huge increase in energy price cap and fuel costs, escalating food shopping bills, and other bills rising with inflation. Combined this has led to a sharp fall in sentiment about discretionary spending. Emma Watkins, head of retirement at Scottish Widows, said: Its tough right now for households trying to manage the surge in day-to-day living costs. We know that many households have failed to boost their savings during the pandemic and that over 70 per cent of households will need to eat into their savings in the next 12 months. A study by Ipsos Murray found that of households that had built up savings in lockdown, nearly three quarters (73 per cent) now expect to have to dip into them in the next 12 months and 17 per cent to exhaust them completely. Only the highest earners added to their household savings."
157,"Dr Sarah Taber is a crop scientist. Here she explains why there will be no wheat shortage as a direct result of the Russia/Ukraine conflict lasting any more than a few short months. There are many reports in the media stating that global wheat shortages of 25 per cent are to be expected because of the war. This is misleading. Heres Dr Taber: Whilst its technically true, it doesnt mean what people think! Missing wheat from the war is actually less than 1 per cent of global wheat crops. When the headline is 25 per cent of world wheat exports missing, that naturally leads people to think oh my god we have to suddenly come up with 25 per cent more wheat in the world out of nowhere. Nope! Only 0.9 per cent. So where does that 25 per cent figure comes from and why is it misleading. Black Sea wheat was 25 per cent of EXPORTS: wheat shipped internationally. Most of the worlds wheat is eaten in the country that grew it! For example, India and China alone grow massive domestic crops and eat most of them. So exports are a small fraction of the global wheat crop. The estimated wheat export shortfall from the Russian invasion is 7 million tons. That sounds like a lot! Unless you look at total global production, which last year was 778 MILLION TONS. The war shortfall is 0.9 per cent of the global wheat crop! Not 25 per cent! We dont have to suddenly increase world wheat production by 25 per cent. We have to increase it by 0.9 per cent. And the worlds farmers already started planting more wheat 4 months ago, when wheat futures rose due to the possibility of the Black Sea conflict. Most of the world plants wheat in the autumn months and harvests them in the spring or early summer. So planting to make up for missing Black Sea wheat has already happened four months ago. India went all-out planting more wheat, and it looks set to continue a 3-year record of rapidly increasing wheat exports. The US planted four million more tons of wheat seed last autumn than normal. Australia, Canada, Argentina, South Africa, and even Brazil are all doing the same. As Dr Saber says, in reality, the world has at least a dozen countries and thousands of square miles looking to replace a whopping global wheat crop shortfall in a matter of months. Again, specific places are facing extreme wheat supply problems. The MENA region (Middle East/North Africa) usually sources from Ukraine. Switching supply chains to India and other sources takes extra time. If theyre further away from India and Ukraine, it takes longer for supplies to get there. What these places are facing is not a wheat shortage but a shipping shortage  not enough wheat in the world. However, their food supply chain problems are still dangerous. A local, shipping-induced shortage that lasts a week can still kill you."
158,"It now looks ever more likely that gas prices will stay high for years, but petrol prices should fall back sooner, according to new analysis. This, of course, might not be the same for diesel prices at the pump. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has ominously warned that the cost of heating your house on gas may well stay up for years rather than months. This is a situation made clear by the loss of Russian supplies and the following infrastructure challenges in replacing them. At the moment  key energy allies, those from the Gulf states, for example, have decided not to play ball in Western markets. However, the CEBR did say that there was some hope for early relief at the petrol stations. It takes the view that by facing those infrastructure challenges means the price of oil should fall by the end of the year. We have all been witness to the connection of rising energy prices since Russias invasion of Ukraine amid uncertainty about supplies. This has caused an escalation in prices at the pump and home heating costs. Russia is by far the biggest exporter of oil and oil products to global markets. It also supplies about 40 per cent of Europes gas. As a direct result of Russias attack on Ukraine  western buyers have ended up boycotting Russian oil. The United States has imposed an oil embargo and released huge reserves to calm markets. Rising Covid cases in China is causing energy demand to fall and increased production elsewhere should see strategic stockpiles being released and high prices denting demand. The CEBR also said its models were predicting Brent back below $90 a barrel in 2024 and that much of that fall is forecast by December 2022. FairFuelUK said this should translate to a reduction of 8p a litre in prices at the pump. Brent was at about $104 a barrel last night. However, it still remains the fact that home heating via gas, will heavily erode disposable income for the foreseeable future. Until terminals are built and operating and demand is reduced, Europe has to choose between facing a recession and continuing to buy Russian gas, the CEBR said."
159,"The economic news for Britain continues to cause concern. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has just forecast that British economic growth will slow sharply to the weakest of any major economy next year. And while this was in a broader downgrade to the worlds growth prospects after Russias invasion of Ukraine, it does not bode well for Boris Johnsons government. The IMF cut its forecast for British gross domestic product growth this year to 3.7% from Januarys forecast of 4.7%, while for 2023 the growth rate was almost halved to 1.2% from 2.3%. Cuts like these will feel like the country is in a recession even if technically the economy is still growing. Consumption is projected to be weaker than expected as inflation erodes real disposable income, while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment, the IMF said. Only last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut its 2022 growth forecast to 3.8% and reduced its 2023 forecast to 1.8%. As well as being the weakest growth of any country in the Group of Seven (G7) next year, the OBR pointed out that the scale of the downgrade is also larger than for any other G7 economy. The IMF also forecasted that inflation in Britain would stay higher than in any big advanced economy, dropping to 5.3% in 2023 from 7.4% this year, compared with falls to 2.9% in the United States and 2.3% in the eurozone. Labour shortages have predominantly come from older workers who have dropped out of the world place since the pandemic the IMF added. The IMF also gave governments advice that they should offer support for households facing big price increases as the cost of living crisis bites, but that it should be focused on poorer households more than anything."
160,"When it comes to the economy  not much is going well right now. Londons FTSE 100 Index fell on Tuesday as data showed some signs of reduced demand for labour. It was healthcare and consumer goods stocks pulling the market down the most. Of course, some healthcare stocks rose rapidly in the pandemic and are now falling back and consumer goods are doing the same as savings wither and sentiment about the cost of living drives a stake through the heart of optimism built up late last year. Rolls-Royce took a hit as it dropped to the bottom of the blue-chip index on brokerage action because it slumped 6.4% after JP Morgan downgraded the aero engineers stock to underweight from neutral. The optics dont look good for the markets do they? The FTSE 100 (FTSE) dropped 0.9%, with Unilever (ULVR.L), Diageo (DGE.L), HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) down between 1.2% and 2.6%, while the domestically focused midcap FTSE 250 index (FTMC) declined 0.9%. While official figures showed Britains jobless rate fell below its level immediately before the coronavirus pandemic, the employment rose by a weaker-than-expected 10,000. But the real thing to keep an eye on is job vacancies. It hit a record high in the three months to March and many, including the Bank of England, are looking for signs that the lack of candidates to fill jobs will push up wages to the extent that it risks a wage-price spiral. In other words  yet more inflation! Inflation data from the US may well see interest rates being pushed up higher  which is to be expected. The global impact of the Russia/Ukraine war has still been fully felt yet and the pandemic is still not over as some countries, especially those with zero-Covid policies are now finding out. The mood is sombre in just about every market there is. But not all, of course."
164,"As robust as the economy has been throughout many events over the decades, there are indicators that the seas could get quite rough. The economy had only just recovered from its decade long erosion of living standards via the bank-led financial crisis when Brexit arrived and just as the uncertainty of that was calming, the pandemic arrived. Then Putins attack on Ukraine sucked all the headlines just as global inflationary pressures were being felt  which has since escalated. So why is credit card debt a signal of rough seas? Yesterday, it was reported by the Bank of England that UK consumers had borrowed a record amount in February, with many economists commenting it was a sign of the cost of living crisis was actually hitting wallets even before Putins invasion of Ukraine pushed energy prices higher. Theres only one day to go before average energy prices zoom up by 54 per cent. According to the BoE, individuals took on a net £1.5bn on credit cards in February. This was the highest monthly amount since records began in 1993. To put that into perspective  that figure is more than 300 per cent higher than the average of £400mn borrowed in the previous six months. Total consumer credit, which includes personal loans and car dealership finance, now stands at £1.9bn net  the highest level in five years. And this is at the time when those households that are able to weather the financial storms ahead have more cash saved for several decades. The FT reports that  Consumer borrowing is usually considered a measure of spending growth, but with inflation at a 30-year high and falling consumer confidence, some economists have warned that it was increasingly a sign of consumers running into debt to maintain their standard of living. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said; Weak sentiment also indicates that the big rise in consumer borrowing in February likely reflects households attempting to maintain their consumption at a time when real disposable income is falling sharply, rather than them going on a spending spree. Tombs went on to say that the data suggest that the economic recovery is about to shift down a gear. UK economic growth finally reaches pre-pandemic activity UK economic growth finally reaches pre-pandemic activity The FT quotes a number of experts who concur. The latest money and credit figures suggest that consumers are increasingly borrowing more to protect their lifestyles from the surge in inflation, echoed Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said it was more likely that the rise reflected households having the confidence to borrow and spend a bit more. The Office for National Statistics bi-weekly survey showed last week that 12 per cent of respondents were using credit cards more than usual to cope with increased prices in the first half of March. The proportion rose to 18 per cent for those aged 30 to 49 and to 21 per cent among renters. The same survey also showed that 10 per cent of people were now borrowing more from family and friends. As reported by The Economic Times yesterday, the BoE governor Andrew Bailey said this week that the UK was facing a historic hit to real incomes this year, as the cost of living crisis spirals. Data by the BoE also showed that consumers are now depositing less money in bank accounts than before the pandemic. Households deposited £4bn in banks and building societies, less than the £6.3bn average in the previous six months and down from the monthly average of £4.6bn in 2019."
167,"There are few commentators that either agrees or commends Rishi Sunaks Spring Statement as worthy of the impending cost of living crisis heading towards one-quarter of all households in Britain. Student fee loans are going to take the brunt as the cost of servicing them will soon be doubled. Indeed, there was much to say about just how cynical this entire statement was. The 5p tax taken off the pump price of diesel and petrol not only meant very little in real terms  but the average cut actually made by retailers was 2.7p  as they took the opportunity to pocket the rest by increasing prices  when the market price of fuel had not actually increased in the first place. Worse, in background documentation of Sunaks statement  it looks rather more like he will increase the same tax by 8p per litre next year. There were other tax manoeuvres that were interpreted as nothing more than political chicanery, but quite possibly the most cynical in all of this was to make university students pay for much of Sunaks giveaways. The cost of the chancellors spring statement is going to be paid primarily by one group of people: future students. The Times reports that  changes to how graduates pay back their student loans will make the Treasury £35.2 billion over the next six years. A graduate who pays £47,000 in repayments today would pay around £100,000 under the new system. This is more than a 100 per cent increase in debt repayment by future students. At the moment, students start repaying their debt once they earn £27,295, at a rate of 9 per cent of anything they earn above this threshold, and the debt is wiped after 30 years. But from next year, they will start repaying once they earn £25,000 and it will last 40 years  in other words, almost their whole working lives. Around 66 per cent of graduates (about 1.5 million) currently take out student fee loans, UK student debt statistics confirm. When we turn the percentage into real numbers, the student loan number reaches a whopping £20 billion each year. The value of outstanding loans at the end of March 2021 reached £141 billion. The Government forecasts the value of outstanding loans to be around £560 billion (2019?20 prices) by the middle of this century. The average debt among the cohort of borrowers who finished their courses in 2020 was just over £46,000."
168,"UK Government officials have been talking to industry players such as crypto exchange Gemini in preparation, according to a CNBC report for the UK to release its plans for regulating the crypto market. A formal announcement is expected within a few weeks. The regulatory framework from the Treasury, the UKs finance ministry, will focus on stablecoins in particular. Stablecoinsany are a cryptocurrency designed to have a relatively stable price, typically through being pegged to a commodity or currency or having its supply regulated by an algorithm. Treasury officials have shown a willingness to understand the complexities of the crypto market and so-called stablecoins, digital assets that derive their value from existing currencies like the U.S. dollar, one source told CNBC. The UKs finance minister, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce the new rules for the crypto market soon, and they are likely to be favourable to the industry, the report said. Leading digital currencies bitcoin and Ethereum have hit all-time highs recently, though as many expect, these highs are usually followed by corrections. The crypto market has boomed over the past 18 months. Stablecoins pegged to assets such as the US dollar, have also experienced a large uptick in usage in recent times, as they represent a stable investment compared with other more volatile cryptocurrencies. This has caused governments and their regulators to quickly attempt to understand and properly monitor the industry. Some countries, such as China, have decided to impose outright bans on crypto activities, while others look to understand and regulate the industry. So far, the UK looks set to work with the crypto industry to mitigate risks and facilitate a safe environment for investors. However, one point of concern is the potential use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and other criminal activity, while Russian users move money to bypass sanctions. Stablecoins can be pegged to anything from gold to oil and being pegged to government-issued currencies are the most popular  dollar-pegged tether, for instance, is the worlds third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, according to CoinMarketCap data. To ensure a Stablecoin holds onto its value, its issuer has reserves of the underlying asset. So for every tether coin issued, it has $1 in its reserves, and holders will always be able to exchange their tether coin for $1. Banks and other institutions have become increasingly interested in entering the crypto markets, and clear regulation is seen as necessary before they can dive in more deeply. It was only last week that the Bank of England noted this interest as it laid out ideas for the UKs first regulatory framework for crypto assets. The BoE has issued a deadline to the banks of June 3 to set out crypto plans and said UK regulators will need new powers."
170,"It really would be nice to think that Putins attack on Ukraine will be short-lived and everyone goes back to doing what they were just as the world was starting to look up from a global pandemic. But whatever happens, one thing we are assured of  this is now wishful thinking. Whilst Ukraine sat at 57th in the global league of world economies and Russia still only accounts for 3 per cent of global GDP even with its massive fossil fuel sales  the world order has changed overnight and there is a lot more bad news on the way, not just politically but economically. First of all, economies are very badly affected by a lack of confidence. Capital flight and moves to safe-haven assets is just one reaction and governments will divert budgets, quite probably from social safety-nets towards military defence spending. There is no escaping the fact that the Russia/Ukraine issue will have serious consequences for the world economy as a whole for years to come. The reality is that Putin has not just re-kindled the Cold War. The Western-led international order that comprised the USA and its allies are now being challenged by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. This fracturing of the world order as we knew it will plunge the world deeper into a geopolitical depression of finger-pointing and acts of aggression. The years ahead now look far riskier now than they did even when Donald Trump kicked off a new and heated economic rivalry between the US and China. Geopolitically speaking, we know that China will be watching events in Europe very closely as Western values are being heavily tested. And although the tensions are different, it could be said that Taiwan is to China as Ukraine is to Russia. Economically though, the fracturing of globalisation will only speed up and capital will inevitably find a new home. In the West, that will be, for instance, the ratcheting up of new technologies to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. It goes without saying that in this more hostile environment the signs for the world economy look ominous. Inflationary pressures will continue and not be short-lived as many predicted  and there will likely be a period of recession in the near future. The spectre of stagflation now beckons Predictions Nouriel Roubini, Professor Emeritus of Economics at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, is a former senior economist for international affairs in the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton Administration and has worked for the IMF, the US Federal Reserve, and the World Bank. In terms of the economy, a global stagflationary recession is now highly likely. Analysts are already asking themselves if the Fed and other major central banks can achieve a soft landing from this crisis and its fallout. Dont count on it. The war in Ukraine will trigger a massive negative supply shock in a global economy that is still reeling from COVID-19 and a year-long build-up of inflationary pressures. The shock will reduce growth and further increase inflation at a time when inflation expectations are already becoming unanchored. The Editorial Board of the Financial Times writes: The Ukraine war amounts to a supply shock  reducing the capacity of the global economy to produce goods and services. Such crises hit growth while raising inflation. That is harder for central banks to deal with than a fall in aggregate demand when spending retrenches. Investors have long feared a return to the stagflation of the 1970s; few, however, anticipated that it would come alongside a return to war. Jason Furman, is a former chair of President Barack Obamas Council of Economic Advisers, is Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard Universitys John F. Kennedy School of Government and Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The longer-term economic consequences for the rest of the world will be far less severe than they are for Russia, but they will still be a persistent challenge for policymakers. There is a risk, albeit a relatively unlikely one, that higher short-run inflation will become embedded in increasingly unanchored inflation expectations, and thus persist. If that happens, central banks already difficult job will become even more complicated. Consequences In the immediate term, the consequences of the Ukraine invasion are plain to see. Stock markets are bouncing up and down  its overall trajectory is south. The result of the pandemic has seen global inflation rising, which it will continue to do. Energy prices will continue to rise as will the cost of food. Both can cause domestic problems for governments all around the world. Dont forget a year of violent protests suddenly emerged in France over rising petrol/diesel prices and the Arab Spring was started originally because of rising food prices. Some of the signs of financial contagion and fear is that the usual safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and USD will strengthen as will the price of gold. It is inevitable that both recession and inflation, commonly known as stagflation will hit Russia very hard. But the same stagflationary effects (on a less severe scale) will also affect the European Union as a whole, as it will the USA. Both are energy-dependent on Russia. The former is a physical requirement, the latter is not in control of global pricing. As jobs get lost and inflation continues its northward trajectory, households will do the inevitable and tighten their belts in expectation of harder times. Interest rates will rise to combat inflation. This will result in banks tightening financial conditions  which will see businesses look at how to save cash and significantly reduce R&D. The effects of stagflation are awful  and dangerous. In its desperation to wrestle control over its self-induced economic spiral, Russia does have a card up its sleeve  it can reduce the sale of oil and gas merely to cause the price to spike and cause further economic pain to the West, whilst keeping income flowing. 1970s oil and energy crisis The 1970s oil crisis and energy crisis caused global mayhem. That crisis led to stagnant economic growth in many countries as oil and gas prices surged. This is where the word stagflation emanated from. And there were winners and losers as always. Fossil fuel producing nations do well, everyone else suffers. Both the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis were the result of some sort of conflict. In Britain, that crisis caused GDP to decline by nearly 4 per cent for over four years. It led to social unrest, we had the three-day week and a state of emergency enforced by the government. Inflation rocketed off to 20 per cent and the IMF was called upon to help Britains finances. In just six years, Britain had four Prime Ministers, a winter of discontent and unemployment reached nearly 12 per cent in the early 1980s. Whilst I am not predicting a renewed 1970s  what are facing today is potentially worse because geopolitical stability is threatened, not just a period of economic stagflation. But however we look at this, it is a cost we have no option but to absorb  it is the cost of defending Western values  of democracy and freedom. The alternative is a price too high to contemplate. Weve already had conflicts on a global scale for these same reasons and one only has to look back to the real complications of geopolitical relationships that brought us WW1 and WW2 to see these dynamics playing out. Dangerous moment Many think that central banks now have the ability to manipulate markets to ensure stability. This was evident with their actions during the very sobering moments of the bank-led financial crisis in 2008/09. However, stagflation offers a very difficult dilemma to central banks  increase interest rates to curb inflation  and the economy gets hurt. It is also not so that central banks will work in unison as they did in the financial crisis because each region will have different stresses (differing values of net imports/exports in differing regions). The other problem for central banks is that in saving the banks that caused the crisis, and household incomes during the pandemic, they in turn have largely run out of the financial clout needed to stave off another global economic event. In summary, Putins aggression has now sparked a new political and economic era  it is a pivotal moment. The geopolitical order is changing and the fight over political ideology is now becoming intense. The cost of the financial crisis was huge, the cost of the pandemic more so  and the axis of China/Russia/Iran and their allies has a renewed confidence. We are entering a global depression  economically and politically  and it may turn very nasty indeed. At the very least  all of this will be painful one way or another."
171,"UK inflation has climbed to a new 30-year high as soaring energy costs, fuel bills and food prices drive the worst cost of living squeeze in decades. Consumer prices rose by 6.2% in the year to February, up from 5.5% in January, the Office for National Statistics reports this morning. Thats the highest inflation reading since March 1992, as household budgets come under intense pressure. On a monthly basis, CPI rose by 0.8% in February, the largest monthly CPI increase between January and February since 2009. And there is worse to come. Last week, the Bank of England predicted inflation would reach 8% in April, and could hit 10% in the autumn when the energy price cap rises again."
172,"Theres a cliche about mid-life. Its supposed to be  and mainly marketed by the media as a crisis, a time when all things wrong  and a lot of what we read about life after 50 is nonsense. The marketers dont know how to appeal to the first generation ever that handsomely outspends all generations behind it combined. The baby-boomers era has largely been replaced with generation X  a demographic born around 1960 to 1985. This generation has a lot to look forward to. Despite all the economic and political turmoil of the last decade or so  they are the wealthiest, biggest spending, fittest, most travelled and carefree of grown-ups to have existed. The over 50s account for more than half of the UKs incomes and 80 per cent of its overall wealth. A third of all businesses are owned by us and over half of all consumer spending comes from us. The number of workers aged over 50 in the UK stands at 10.4 million  an increase of 2.4 million in the last decade alone. Generation X now accounts for over half of all UK household expenditure on health, recreation and culture, alcoholic beverages, restaurants and hotels and that spending has been rising faster than any other demographic. In fact, we outspent any other group in 9 out of 12 spending categories. If it wasnt for us, the UK economy would be considerably worse off (source). The ONS reported back in 2014 that the number of over 50s households has risen from 12 million in 2003 to 14 million in 2012 but in last four years alone  another 4.7 million over 50s have arrived. Split into 5 year groups  the groups 50-54 (the largest single group) and 55-59 are now the largest two groups of people in the UK (source). And yet, the over 50s are treated by the marketers and a majority of brands like were suffering from incontinence and have no teeth. Im not struggling with any form of serious health decline or pondering my own death. I dont know about you but Im happy with who I am thanks  and really looking forward to the next fifteen years. In the UK, theres not much data about us, which always surprises me. In the US its different. The Harvard Business Review (source) reports that  portrayals of those over 50 are negative 28% of the time, compared to only 4% of the time for younger people. Seventy percent of the time, people in this demographic are shown in isolated situations  often seated, alone, with a partner, or with a medical professional where they were the recipients of care. In another American study, they found that although 46% of the U.S. adult population is age 50-plus, only 15% of online and marketing images containing adults include people this age (source). From what I can tell, its no different in the UK. Its not like were invisible. We drive the flashiest cars, have the finest clothes and accessories (by money spent) and a lot of us have a kitchen island. We mid-aged Brits buy more wine fridges per household than any country in continental Europe (source). This is because we drink more  whilst striving to enjoy ourselves more. Research (source) has found that, contrary to stereotypes, people over 50 are not set in their ways. The over 50s  are focused on anti-ageing and breaking the mould of what 50 looks like, researchers at California State University and Southern Connecticut State University wrote in a study published by the Journal of Behavioral Studies in Business (source). I dont see that as being any different in the UK. Contrary to the marketing images we all see, the average age of a car-buyer in the UK is 54. At Jaguar, it is 56, at BMW its 56 and Mercedes, its 54. In fact, the average age of a new Ford buyer is 56, for Volkswagen, it is 54, for Toyota, it is 63. Even cheap, fun, youngster-friendly Fiats are bought by people whose average age is 49. What a great time to be in tier 2 of life. Youre set to have more fun, have more choice and generally enjoy life, unlike any other generation before us or around us. Welcome to life after 50  statistically speaking  this is set to be the best time of your life."
173,"Today, those over 50 are an entirely new generation with more economic power than ever before. They have the energy and experience to get the most out of life and are now seriously defying the midlife cliche. In recent years, life, in general, has got more challenging for all sorts of reasons. The political and economic future is more fragile. In addition, there have been more political scandals and the deepest economic recessions in the last 20 years than in recorded British history. And we are on the verge of great change. The climate crisis is now recognised as exactly that  a crisis. The transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy will now be a big deal for all of us thanks to Russia. The talk all over the world is about designing future prospects  about de-coupling and de-globalisation, about reducing foreign dependence and bringing supply chains home and favouring domestic production and finance. Its also about how technology will accelerate, how algorithms will determine more of our lives and how employment will change. Today theres a growing and significant proportion of the population over the age of 50. In fact, 38 per cent are now in this demographic (source) in the UK today. And whilst many are trying to juggle work, family and their own lives they now have one eye on the realisation that retirement is on the horizon or rapidly approaching. Defying the midlife cliché Those in their 50s and 60s are not the same as the generation before them. Most people are healthier, more active, more alive in their skins than ever before and are now defying clichéd representations of so-called later life. Not only does this exciting group of people hold about 80 per cent of the UKs wealth  and have the highest level of disposable income, they are picking up new hobbies, setting up new businesses, travelling and seeking out new experiences. And far from winding down and resigning themselves to a life of gardening and daytime TV, they are internet savvy, unafraid to use new technology and ready to make the most of life. To challenge this cliched representation, it helps to know some interesting numbers. For instance, the average age of the new car buyer is in the mid-50s (source). A third of all businesses in Britain are owned by the over 50s. Half of the over 50s nowadays are having sex only marginally behind those half our age (source)  but youd never believe that looking at advertising on television, in the newspapers or in magazines. The over 50s now have more impact and influence on the UK economy than ever before. In 2016, this group spent more money than the younger generation for the first time in history  spending £376 billion on things such as food, entertainment and clothes. A whopping 62% of over 50s now aim to spend their savings, with fewer people believing that leaving an inheritance to their children is a priority (source). The bank of mum and dad has entrenched a feeling that midlife is now to be exploited and enjoyed. And many in midlife do not have large families like the generations before them, making them less financially obligated  assuming they are not looking after ageing parents of course. This lively demographic is an entirely new generation of people wanting the finer things in life, with the time and money to enjoy. Those in midlife are also increasingly becoming politically more powerful as data shows this age group also vote more than any other."
174,"We all know we need to be as secure online as we are anywhere. We all know that cybercrime has been increasing every year  but in the last twelve months of the pandemic  cybercrime rose by 31 per cent. The most common type of cybercrime attack was hacking through email or social media, which accounted for 53% of attacks over the year. Scams caused by the hacking of business computer servers was revealed as the second most common type of attack on businesses over the 12 month period. In terms of losses, people and companies based in London took the brunt of cybercrime, with the West Midlands, the South-East and the South-West following behind. Sarah Knowles, Senior Security Consultant at Nexor said: The last six months have opened up many opportunities for malicious hackers to intercept individuals and businesses as we have been thrown out of our usual routines and away from reliable systems. Across the country, millions of people switched to work from home and for many businesses, this left the door ajar as cybersecurity took a back seat with such short notice. The problem is that the criminals would prefer to use cybercrime than other forms of crime and are now attacking home addresses as they know so many people are actually at home and working from there. There has been an enormous upswing of online activity from home  and so this is where much of the targeting by cybercriminals now focuses its attention. Having said all that, the fact is  cybercrime is worse than you think. The actual scale of digitally enabled crime in the UK is dramatically under-reported, new statistics indicate. According to estimates compiled by the Office for National Statistics, there were 4.4 million fraud offences in the 12 months to 30 September 2020. But police-recorded offences collated through the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) via Action Fraud, Cifas and UK Finance, showed just 16.6% of frauds are being reported (source). That means online fraud offences are something like five times worse than we are being warned about. It also means your chances of being caught up in one is really quite a lot higher than you might think. First  The Basics The government produces its own recommendations when it comes to online cybercrime security via the National Cyber Security Centre. These basic tips are really the minimum standard you should be doing to protect your household from malicious cyberattacks that could end in identity fraud and/or financial loss, along with a whole host of other, no less stressful outcomes. If you are not doing all of these things, you are not safe and weaknesses will be found. Top tips from the National Cyber Security Centre: are Protect your email by using a strong and separate password Cybercriminals can use your email to access many of your personal accounts, leaving you vulnerable to identity theft. Install the latest software and app updates Software and app updates contain vital security updates to help protect your devices from cyber crime. Turn on two-factor authentication on your email Two-factor authentication is recommended for email accounts to make sure your data is secure. Password managers: how they help you secure passwords Using a password manager can help you create and remember passwords. Secure smartphones and tablets with a screen lock Screen locks offer your devices an important extra layer of security. Always back up your most important data Safeguard your most important data, such as your photos and key documents, by backing them up to an external hard drive or a cloud-based storage system. Working From Home BusinessFirstOnline makes a simple recommendation when it comes to working from home. Have a Device Dedicated to Work. They say: Mixing work and personal life are ill-advised, and the same goes for devices. When remote working, always make sure that work is being done on devices dedicated to work instead of using personal devices. The reason for this is that personal devices could be compromised. Plus, theres always the risk of a remote worker losing their personal device, putting the company in possible jeopardy. When possible, companies should hand out work devices to all remote workers. Remote workers should then do all of their work on said device (source). Banking Online  Minimum habits Here are some more basics you should do (full resource source here). Dont re-use the same passwords for different accounts. Use a strong password. Avoid passwords made up of common words, numbers or keyboard patterns (such as password or 123456), and dont include personal information, such as your name, date of birth, or any family members details. Read more about password security in this guide. Never share your full password or PIN number. Banks will never ask for your full PIN or password  instead, they will ask for specific numbers or letters, for example, the first and third character from your password. Always log out of your online banking session, especially if you use a device that others have access to. Be cautious when using a public computer to access your online banking, for example, library computers. They may not have the right level of security software. Ask the library staff for more information. Only use secure Wi-Fi networks to access your online banking. Dont use public networks, such as those in cafes or train stations  it may be possible for people on the same network to access your details. Check your balance and transactions regularly, and report anything you dont recognise to your bank. Regularly check that your personal details are correct and up to date. Beware of Scams A common scam is where fraudsters call up, telling you your account has been hacked and to move money to a safe account. They can even use technology that makes it look like theyre phoning from the banks official number. Your bank will never phone you out of the blue, asking for your PIN number or password, and they wont ask you to transfer money to a different account. The Royal Mail is used in so many scams that it has a specific section on its website to help people detect and report fraudulent messages. That service has been especially busy recently after people received emails and texts supposedly from the Royal Mail demanding a shipping payment. The Royal Mail also warned customers about similar scams delivered by text. This method of attack is particularly dangerous because its less common and people are therefore less likely to be alert to the threat. Furthermore, both legitimate and fraudulent texts are typically very short  perhaps one or two sentences. As such, recipients have little information to determine the authenticity of the message, and they may be tempted to follow the link to find out more. Texts also make it easier for scammers to hide their identity. They dont need to replicate official logos or the senders address, and the messages come from a nondescript phone number. However, in most cases, you can find out where the phone number is registered by looking it up online. If you are ever in any doubt whether a message is genuine, you should contact the Royal Mail by visiting its website (never follow a link from an email or text) or your local delivery office. If you are unsure visit the Royal Mail website here and you can check out any parcel or delivery. Buying online If youre planning on buying from a website youve never used before or havent heard of, check its reviews online and run the address through Googles Safe Browsing tool to check for security threats. In fact, you can use this tool for any website. Dont forget to type in www first and make sure you have the correct details for an instant result. Britains National Cyber Security Centre has lost of advice which you can read HERE  but the basics are: If possible  type a website address that you trust directly into the address bar  not the search bar. Use a credit card rather than a debit card. Use PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Using these platforms to authorise your payments means the retailer doesnt even see your payment details. They also provide their own dispute resolution should anything go wrong. However, they may not provide the same protection as a card provider, so check their terms and conditions before your sign up. When its time to pay for your items, check theres a closed padlock icon in the browsers address bar. It will look like this: locked padlock on a URL bar in browser Only provide enough details to complete your purchase. If possible, dont create an account for the online store when making your payment. You can usually complete your purchase without having to create an account We live in a digital age  and so its up to you to keep safe. You already have security habits such as locking the front and back doors, making sure window locks are secure and that your car is locked and so on  now do the same online to make sure you are not a victim of cybercrime."
175,"A report generated by the government and published to the House of Commons library, looked into the attitudes of the over 50s, their working lives and thoughts about retirement. Whilst it found some rather obvious points it also raised some interesting points (source). Dont forget that since this report was generated (the last one), the retirement age as of 2020 is 66 for men and women and then 67 by 2028. By far the leading reason for not retiring was needing to earn money (31 per cent). Following this, I think Im too young to stop was the second most common response (13 per cent), while I enjoy the work I do was third (9 per cent). The proportion of respondents who claimed the dominant reason for not being retired was enjoyment of work increased significantly with age; 5 per cent among those in their 50s, 15 per cent among those in their 60s and rising to 33 per cent of those aged 70 plus. Here are some more interesting thoughts from those not retired yet but thinking about the future. The average age at which respondents thought they would stop working and retire was 65.2 (for men and women). At the time, the retirement age was 65. Fifty six per cent said that they now expect to retire later than planned. Thirty nine per cent of respondents not currently retired said that working part time or flexible hours before stopping work altogether would be the best way to retire. Seventeen per cent preferred a less demanding job before retiring altogether, while the same proportion said working full time and then stopping work altogether would be the best way to retire. Fifteen per cent of respondents not currently retired and under 60 years old would like to stop work altogether and retire between the ages of 60 and 65 while 74 per cent would like to be in work still (either full time or part time). Forty per cent of those not currently retired and under 65 years old would like to be retired between the ages of 65 and 70, while 48 per cent would like to still be in work either full time or part time. About a third of those currently not retired said they had some interest in moving to self-employment (33 per cent) or starting a new career (36 per cent). Of these that had retired, there was some experience and advice for those thinking about it. Forty six per cent of those who had retired said that they had retired earlier than planned, 44 per cent said that they had retired at the age they planned, and 11 per cent said they had retired later than planned. More than one in five (22 per cent) of those who had retired miss work and just under a quarter (23 per cent) wished they had worked longer before retiring. Thirty nine per cent of people who had retired said that they dont miss anything about work but 38 per cent said that they miss the social interaction, and 27 per cent said they miss the income. Thirty six per cent of people who had retired said that they would advise someone who was thinking about stopping work altogether and retiring to consider switching to flexible or part time work for a period first, 20 per cent said If you can, take a break from work and then make a decision, while 32 per cent said they would advise retirement. What all of this says is that when you reach mid life, you have to start thinking about the future. If possible, make plans in case of the unexpected and if not, keep learning new skills to make you more indispensable or more attractive to other employers. Dont forget that more than half of people now think they will retire later than planned and almost as many were expecting to be working part-time  mainly to supplement incomes."
176,"In 1841 the average newborn girl in Britain was not expected to see her 43rd birthday. Thankfully times have changed and so have life expectancies in the 170 years since the UKs first lifetable was constructed and theres good reason to think about the fact youll probably reach an older age than you think. The information contained in the Decennial Life Tables release, produced every 10 years, provides a fascinating insight into those changes, spanning seventeen decades. The low life expectancies of the 19th century can be explained by the higher number of infant deaths. Survival past the first year of life was historically a predominant factor in life expectancies and once a child had reached five years of age, he or she was much more likely to reach a greater age. So why am I telling you all this? Well, theres something else about life expectancy we should all consider  and that is  that we are likely to live longer than we might think. There are around 600 million people over the age of 60 across the globe  this is about 8.5 per cent. And astonishingly, this figure which is expected to double by 2025, according to the United Nations. When I was born in 1960, my life expectancy at the time was 67. By the time I was a teenager, most people died within a decade of retiring and middle-aged people were already looking tired and old by the time they were 40. By the time I reached the grand age of 50, my life expectancy was now 78. And a decade later, it is now officially 81.2 years. However, on this basis, for every four and a half years I keep going  theoretically, I get to live another year. So by the time, Im 80, I should expect to live to 87. And if I get to 87, I should just about get to 88. However, if I get to 85 in the first place  statistically, I get to live even longer because I move out of the category of average and join a growing band of oldies who reach 90.8 years. For instance  the Office for National Statistics confirms a number of little gems that we should all be aware of. There were more than half a million people aged 90 and over living in the UK in 2014, almost triple the number thirty years earlier. For every 100 people aged 90 and over in 2014, 29 were male and 71 were female The number of centenarians (people aged 100 and over) living in the UK has risen by 72% over the last decade to 14,450 in 2014. Male life expectancy has increased from 70.8 in 1980-82 to 79.1 in 2012-14. Female life expectancy has increased from 76.8 to 82.8 during the same period. The most common age of death was 86 years for men and 89 years for women. This is higher than the current average life expectancy at birth. Men aged 85 in 2012-14 could expect to live to 90.8 whereas women could expect to live to 91.8. Three in 10 of those aged 80 and over reported being lonely in 2014 to 2015. A third of those over 80 reported very high levels of life satisfaction in 2014 to 2015. Around 1 in 10 (11%) of those aged 75 and over reported having no close friends in 2011 to 2012. The league table of centenarians places Britain at a reasonable 13th position with 21.5 people per 100,000 population. The top slots are held by Japan, South Korea and much to my surprise Barbados. In Europe  Portugal, France, Italy and Spain are ahead of us Brits in 4th, 6th, 7th and 12th position respectively. The point being  youd better prepare for a longer life and older age than you might have first thought."
177,"More and more of us will start to wonder what will happen to property prices when interest rates keep rising. Theres a difference between being up to your eyes in mortgage debt to get onto the housing ladder and having a lengthy fixed rate mortgage you can now easily afford. Dinner tables around the country will see the property price discussion become far more frequent in future months as the issue becomes a hot topic. One-third of all homes in the UK are mortgage-free. The truth is that rising inflation will cause interest rates to follow. But rising inflation usually pushes up property prices in the medium term. In fact, over the last four decades property prices have risen about 400 per cent and that was with controlled inflationary pressures. The FT reports that  Considering double-digit property prices growth, you might think rising interest rates would take some heat out of the market. In a recent note, research group Capital Economics described property as the weak link as interest rates rise. Nevertheless, it predicted rates would have to get to around 4 per cent to trigger price falls unless quantitative tightening causes a greater economic wobble than expected (rising unemployment would spook mortgage lenders much more than rising interest rates). This analysis forgets one thing though. When the pandemic got itself into full swing and the government created the furlough scheme  savings rocketed. Then the government significantly reduced stamp duty for a limited period, which caused a buying spree of property not seen since before the 1988 property crash. In other words  transactions shot up, taking future sales away from the market. In the late 1980s and early 1990s  the big problem was that no one put their properties on the market because they couldnt find a replacement to move to. Today, the average estate agent has just 26 properties for sale  a drop of a fifth in the last year alone, with no sign of that fall slowing. Much of that is caused by property arriving on the market and selling much quicker. Danny Luke, from Quick Move Now, which provided national data sets for property listings said  As you can see from the figures, the number of properties coming to the market has fallen significantly in most areas, and nationally weve seen a fall of 21%. Luke went on to add  Every region of England and Wales has seen significant rises in the percentage of housing stock that is sold subject to contract. This demonstrates high demand for property, despite rising interest rates, rising property prices and significant increases in the cost of living. Many property experts predicted a stabilising of property prices or perhaps even a slight fall in prices in the first part of this year, but that price correction is yet to materialise, despite mounting external pressures. And those mounting pressures are mounting a lot quicker than many expected. Confidence in any market of value is key and many households are already tightening their belts in fear of disposable incomes vapourising in the face of rising costs of the basics  food and energy especially. The outlook for property prices is that they will cool to probably zero (inflation) by the time data becomes available at the end of the year (Q4) or the very beginning of next year."
178,"It was only last week when The Economic Times reported that  the Bank of England highlighted that UK consumers had borrowed a record amount in February, with many economists commenting it was a sign that the cost of living crisis was actually hitting wallets even before Putins invasion of Ukraine pushed energy prices higher. But now theres only one day to go before average energy prices zoom up by 54 per cent. Today, we are now seeing just how damaging the cost of living crisis is becoming  or more alarmingly  just how fast it is taking effect. Household savings in the UK are now being drained at the fastest rate for nearly ten years. The financial editor of The Times reports that  About 40 per cent of households built up their savings during lockdown but 60 per cent did not, according to the Scottish Widows Household Finance Index. It found that the amount of cash left for discretionary spending after living expenses has fallen by the sharpest amount since 2013. The measure of peoples perceptions of financial wellbeing fell to 38.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, its lowest since the start of the pandemic two years ago. A score of 50 per cent indicates no change on the previous quarter. The rising cost of living is now the biggest money concern of almost half of households according to Aldermore Banks latest savings tracker, which surveyed 4,000 UK adults. Households now face what many consider to be a perfect storm of financial strain -everything from National Insurance tax hikes alongside the huge increase in energy price cap and fuel costs, escalating food shopping bills, and other bills rising with inflation. Combined this has led to a sharp fall in sentiment about discretionary spending. Emma Watkins, head of retirement at Scottish Widows, said: Its tough right now for households trying to manage the surge in day-to-day living costs. We know that many households have failed to boost their savings during the pandemic and that over 70 per cent of households will need to eat into their savings in the next 12 months. A study by Ipsos Murray found that of households that had built up savings in lockdown, nearly three quarters (73 per cent) now expect to have to dip into them in the next 12 months and 17 per cent to exhaust them completely. Only the highest earners added to their household savings."
179,"The economic news for Britain continues to cause concern. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has just forecast that British economic growth will slow sharply to the weakest of any major economy next year. And while this was in a broader downgrade to the worlds growth prospects after Russias invasion of Ukraine, it does not bode well for Boris Johnsons government. The IMF cut its forecast for British gross domestic product growth this year to 3.7% from Januarys forecast of 4.7%, while for 2023 the growth rate was almost halved to 1.2% from 2.3%. Cuts like these will feel like the country is in a recession even if technically the economy is still growing. Consumption is projected to be weaker than expected as inflation erodes real disposable income, while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment, the IMF said. Only last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut its 2022 growth forecast to 3.8% and reduced its 2023 forecast to 1.8%. As well as being the weakest growth of any country in the Group of Seven (G7) next year, the OBR pointed out that the scale of the downgrade is also larger than for any other G7 economy. The IMF also forecasted that inflation in Britain would stay higher than in any big advanced economy, dropping to 5.3% in 2023 from 7.4% this year, compared with falls to 2.9% in the United States and 2.3% in the eurozone. Labour shortages have predominantly come from older workers who have dropped out of the world place since the pandemic the IMF added. The IMF also gave governments advice that they should offer support for households facing big price increases as the cost of living crisis bites, but that it should be focused on poorer households more than anything."
180,"When it comes to the economy  not much is going well right now. Londons FTSE 100 Index fell on Tuesday as data showed some signs of reduced demand for labour. It was healthcare and consumer goods stocks pulling the market down the most. Of course, some healthcare stocks rose rapidly in the pandemic and are now falling back and consumer goods are doing the same as savings wither and sentiment about the cost of living drives a stake through the heart of optimism built up late last year. Rolls-Royce took a hit as it dropped to the bottom of the blue-chip index on brokerage action because it slumped 6.4% after JP Morgan downgraded the aero engineers stock to underweight from neutral. The optics dont look good for the markets do they? The FTSE 100 (FTSE) dropped 0.9%, with Unilever (ULVR.L), Diageo (DGE.L), HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) down between 1.2% and 2.6%, while the domestically focused midcap FTSE 250 index (FTMC) declined 0.9%. While official figures showed Britains jobless rate fell below its level immediately before the coronavirus pandemic, the employment rose by a weaker-than-expected 10,000. But the real thing to keep an eye on is job vacancies. It hit a record high in the three months to March and many, including the Bank of England, are looking for signs that the lack of candidates to fill jobs will push up wages to the extent that it risks a wage-price spiral. In other words  yet more inflation! Inflation data from the US may well see interest rates being pushed up higher  which is to be expected. The global impact of the Russia/Ukraine war has still been fully felt yet and the pandemic is still not over as some countries, especially those with zero-Covid policies are now finding out. The mood is sombre in just about every market there is. But not all, of course."
181,"As robust as the economy has been throughout many events over the decades, there are indicators that the seas could get quite rough. The economy had only just recovered from its decade long erosion of living standards via the bank-led financial crisis when Brexit arrived and just as the uncertainty of that was calming, the pandemic arrived. Then Putins attack on Ukraine sucked all the headlines just as global inflationary pressures were being felt  which has since escalated. So why is credit card debt a signal of rough seas? Yesterday, it was reported by the Bank of England that UK consumers had borrowed a record amount in February, with many economists commenting it was a sign of the cost of living crisis was actually hitting wallets even before Putins invasion of Ukraine pushed energy prices higher. Theres only one day to go before average energy prices zoom up by 54 per cent. According to the BoE, individuals took on a net £1.5bn on credit cards in February. This was the highest monthly amount since records began in 1993. To put that into perspective  that figure is more than 300 per cent higher than the average of £400mn borrowed in the previous six months. Total consumer credit, which includes personal loans and car dealership finance, now stands at £1.9bn net  the highest level in five years. And this is at the time when those households that are able to weather the financial storms ahead have more cash saved for several decades. The FT reports that  Consumer borrowing is usually considered a measure of spending growth, but with inflation at a 30-year high and falling consumer confidence, some economists have warned that it was increasingly a sign of consumers running into debt to maintain their standard of living. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said; Weak sentiment also indicates that the big rise in consumer borrowing in February likely reflects households attempting to maintain their consumption at a time when real disposable income is falling sharply, rather than them going on a spending spree. Tombs went on to say that the data suggest that the economic recovery is about to shift down a gear. UK economic growth finally reaches pre-pandemic activity UK economic growth finally reaches pre-pandemic activity The FT quotes a number of experts who concur. The latest money and credit figures suggest that consumers are increasingly borrowing more to protect their lifestyles from the surge in inflation, echoed Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said it was more likely that the rise reflected households having the confidence to borrow and spend a bit more. The Office for National Statistics bi-weekly survey showed last week that 12 per cent of respondents were using credit cards more than usual to cope with increased prices in the first half of March. The proportion rose to 18 per cent for those aged 30 to 49 and to 21 per cent among renters. The same survey also showed that 10 per cent of people were now borrowing more from family and friends. As reported by The Economic Times yesterday, the BoE governor Andrew Bailey said this week that the UK was facing a historic hit to real incomes this year, as the cost of living crisis spirals. Data by the BoE also showed that consumers are now depositing less money in bank accounts than before the pandemic. Households deposited £4bn in banks and building societies, less than the £6.3bn average in the previous six months and down from the monthly average of £4.6bn in 2019."
183,"UK Government officials have been talking to industry players such as crypto exchange Gemini in preparation, according to a CNBC report for the UK to release its plans for regulating the crypto market. A formal announcement is expected within a few weeks. The regulatory framework from the Treasury, the UKs finance ministry, will focus on stablecoins in particular. Stablecoinsany are a cryptocurrency designed to have a relatively stable price, typically through being pegged to a commodity or currency or having its supply regulated by an algorithm. Treasury officials have shown a willingness to understand the complexities of the crypto market and so-called stablecoins, digital assets that derive their value from existing currencies like the U.S. dollar, one source told CNBC. The UKs finance minister, Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce the new rules for the crypto market soon, and they are likely to be favourable to the industry, the report said. Leading digital currencies bitcoin and Ethereum have hit all-time highs recently, though as many expect, these highs are usually followed by corrections. The crypto market has boomed over the past 18 months. Stablecoins pegged to assets such as the US dollar, have also experienced a large uptick in usage in recent times, as they represent a stable investment compared with other more volatile cryptocurrencies. This has caused governments and their regulators to quickly attempt to understand and properly monitor the industry. Some countries, such as China, have decided to impose outright bans on crypto activities, while others look to understand and regulate the industry. So far, the UK looks set to work with the crypto industry to mitigate risks and facilitate a safe environment for investors. However, one point of concern is the potential use of cryptocurrencies in money laundering and other criminal activity, while Russian users move money to bypass sanctions. Stablecoins can be pegged to anything from gold to oil and being pegged to government-issued currencies are the most popular  dollar-pegged tether, for instance, is the worlds third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, according to CoinMarketCap data. To ensure a Stablecoin holds onto its value, its issuer has reserves of the underlying asset. So for every tether coin issued, it has $1 in its reserves, and holders will always be able to exchange their tether coin for $1. Banks and other institutions have become increasingly interested in entering the crypto markets, and clear regulation is seen as necessary before they can dive in more deeply. It was only last week that the Bank of England noted this interest as it laid out ideas for the UKs first regulatory framework for crypto assets. The BoE has issued a deadline to the banks of June 3 to set out crypto plans and said UK regulators will need new powers."
184,"The FT reports that  Some of the worlds most respected oil traders have predicted crude prices could climb beyond $200 a barrel this year owing to a growing international boycott of Russia and a lack of alternative sources of supply. Pierre Andurand, one of the sectors best-known hedge fund managers, said supplies of Russian oil into Europe would disappear in the aftermath of Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine, leading to a lasting reshaping of global energy markets. Andurand went on to say  Wakey, wakey. We are not going back to normal business in a few months, he told the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne. I think were losing the Russian supply on the European side forever. Crude could even hit $250 barrel this year, double current levels, he said. Oil prices jumped 5% to over $121 a barrel yesterday as disruptions to Russian and Kazakh crude exports via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline added to worries over tight global supplies. Matters got worse when the latest rise came as Brent crude prices lifted on the back of more supply uncertainty, particularly in light of attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia over the weekend. Yesterday, we saw chancellor Rishi Sunak make his spring statement that turned out to be a mini-budget. The so-called giveaway really saw the Treasury office set to rake in billions of pounds in extra oil and gas revenue as the conflict in Ukraine drives up energy prices even further. At $122 a barrel, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) now expects the taxman to receive £25billion from the North Sea fossil fuel industry over the six years to 2026-27. That is £13.6billion more than forecast in the Budget just six months ago, meaning the tax take will more than double. The one year 5p tax reduction at the pump for one year will cost the Treasury £2.5 billion."
185,"It really would be nice to think that Putins attack on Ukraine will be short-lived and everyone goes back to doing what they were just as the world was starting to look up from a global pandemic. But whatever happens, one thing we are assured of  this is now wishful thinking. Whilst Ukraine sat at 57th in the global league of world economies and Russia still only accounts for 3 per cent of global GDP even with its massive fossil fuel sales  the world order has changed overnight and there is a lot more bad news on the way, not just politically but economically. First of all, economies are very badly affected by a lack of confidence. Capital flight and moves to safe-haven assets is just one reaction and governments will divert budgets, quite probably from social safety-nets towards military defence spending. There is no escaping the fact that the Russia/Ukraine issue will have serious consequences for the world economy as a whole for years to come. The reality is that Putin has not just re-kindled the Cold War. The Western-led international order that comprised the USA and its allies are now being challenged by Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. This fracturing of the world order as we knew it will plunge the world deeper into a geopolitical depression of finger-pointing and acts of aggression. The years ahead now look far riskier now than they did even when Donald Trump kicked off a new and heated economic rivalry between the US and China. Geopolitically speaking, we know that China will be watching events in Europe very closely as Western values are being heavily tested. And although the tensions are different, it could be said that Taiwan is to China as Ukraine is to Russia. Economically though, the fracturing of globalisation will only speed up and capital will inevitably find a new home. In the West, that will be, for instance, the ratcheting up of new technologies to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. It goes without saying that in this more hostile environment the signs for the world economy look ominous. Inflationary pressures will continue and not be short-lived as many predicted  and there will likely be a period of recession in the near future. The spectre of stagflation now beckons Predictions Nouriel Roubini, Professor Emeritus of Economics at New York Universitys Stern School of Business, is a former senior economist for international affairs in the White Houses Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton Administration and has worked for the IMF, the US Federal Reserve, and the World Bank. In terms of the economy, a global stagflationary recession is now highly likely. Analysts are already asking themselves if the Fed and other major central banks can achieve a soft landing from this crisis and its fallout. Dont count on it. The war in Ukraine will trigger a massive negative supply shock in a global economy that is still reeling from COVID-19 and a year-long build-up of inflationary pressures. The shock will reduce growth and further increase inflation at a time when inflation expectations are already becoming unanchored. The Editorial Board of the Financial Times writes: The Ukraine war amounts to a supply shock  reducing the capacity of the global economy to produce goods and services. Such crises hit growth while raising inflation. That is harder for central banks to deal with than a fall in aggregate demand when spending retrenches. Investors have long feared a return to the stagflation of the 1970s; few, however, anticipated that it would come alongside a return to war. Jason Furman, is a former chair of President Barack Obamas Council of Economic Advisers, is Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard Universitys John F. Kennedy School of Government and Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The longer-term economic consequences for the rest of the world will be far less severe than they are for Russia, but they will still be a persistent challenge for policymakers. There is a risk, albeit a relatively unlikely one, that higher short-run inflation will become embedded in increasingly unanchored inflation expectations, and thus persist. If that happens, central banks already difficult job will become even more complicated. Consequences In the immediate term, the consequences of the Ukraine invasion are plain to see. Stock markets are bouncing up and down  its overall trajectory is south. The result of the pandemic has seen global inflation rising, which it will continue to do. Energy prices will continue to rise as will the cost of food. Both can cause domestic problems for governments all around the world. Dont forget a year of violent protests suddenly emerged in France over rising petrol/diesel prices and the Arab Spring was started originally because of rising food prices. Some of the signs of financial contagion and fear is that the usual safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc and USD will strengthen as will the price of gold. It is inevitable that both recession and inflation, commonly known as stagflation will hit Russia very hard. But the same stagflationary effects (on a less severe scale) will also affect the European Union as a whole, as it will the USA. Both are energy-dependent on Russia. The former is a physical requirement, the latter is not in control of global pricing. As jobs get lost and inflation continues its northward trajectory, households will do the inevitable and tighten their belts in expectation of harder times. Interest rates will rise to combat inflation. This will result in banks tightening financial conditions  which will see businesses look at how to save cash and significantly reduce R&D. The effects of stagflation are awful  and dangerous. In its desperation to wrestle control over its self-induced economic spiral, Russia does have a card up its sleeve  it can reduce the sale of oil and gas merely to cause the price to spike and cause further economic pain to the West, whilst keeping income flowing. 1970s oil and energy crisis The 1970s oil crisis and energy crisis caused global mayhem. That crisis led to stagnant economic growth in many countries as oil and gas prices surged. This is where the word stagflation emanated from. And there were winners and losers as always. Fossil fuel producing nations do well, everyone else suffers. Both the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis were the result of some sort of conflict. In Britain, that crisis caused GDP to decline by nearly 4 per cent for over four years. It led to social unrest, we had the three-day week and a state of emergency enforced by the government. Inflation rocketed off to 20 per cent and the IMF was called upon to help Britains finances. In just six years, Britain had four Prime Ministers, a winter of discontent and unemployment reached nearly 12 per cent in the early 1980s. Whilst I am not predicting a renewed 1970s  what are facing today is potentially worse because geopolitical stability is threatened, not just a period of economic stagflation. But however we look at this, it is a cost we have no option but to absorb  it is the cost of defending Western values  of democracy and freedom. The alternative is a price too high to contemplate. Weve already had conflicts on a global scale for these same reasons and one only has to look back to the real complications of geopolitical relationships that brought us WW1 and WW2 to see these dynamics playing out. Dangerous moment Many think that central banks now have the ability to manipulate markets to ensure stability. This was evident with their actions during the very sobering moments of the bank-led financial crisis in 2008/09. However, stagflation offers a very difficult dilemma to central banks  increase interest rates to curb inflation  and the economy gets hurt. It is also not so that central banks will work in unison as they did in the financial crisis because each region will have different stresses (differing values of net imports/exports in differing regions). The other problem for central banks is that in saving the banks that caused the crisis, and household incomes during the pandemic, they in turn have largely run out of the financial clout needed to stave off another global economic event. In summary, Putins aggression has now sparked a new political and economic era  it is a pivotal moment. The geopolitical order is changing and the fight over political ideology is now becoming intense. The cost of the financial crisis was huge, the cost of the pandemic more so  and the axis of China/Russia/Iran and their allies has a renewed confidence. We are entering a global depression  economically and politically  and it may turn very nasty indeed. At the very least  all of this will be painful one way or another."
186,"Theres a cliche about mid-life. Its supposed to be  and mainly marketed by the media as a crisis, a time when all things wrong  and a lot of what we read about life after 50 is nonsense. The marketers dont know how to appeal to the first generation ever that handsomely outspends all generations behind it combined. The baby-boomers era has largely been replaced with generation X  a demographic born around 1960 to 1985. This generation has a lot to look forward to. Despite all the economic and political turmoil of the last decade or so  they are the wealthiest, biggest spending, fittest, most travelled and carefree of grown-ups to have existed. The over 50s account for more than half of the UKs incomes and 80 per cent of its overall wealth. A third of all businesses are owned by us and over half of all consumer spending comes from us. The number of workers aged over 50 in the UK stands at 10.4 million  an increase of 2.4 million in the last decade alone. Generation X now accounts for over half of all UK household expenditure on health, recreation and culture, alcoholic beverages, restaurants and hotels and that spending has been rising faster than any other demographic. In fact, we outspent any other group in 9 out of 12 spending categories. If it wasnt for us, the UK economy would be considerably worse off (source). The ONS reported back in 2014 that the number of over 50s households has risen from 12 million in 2003 to 14 million in 2012 but in last four years alone  another 4.7 million over 50s have arrived. Split into 5 year groups  the groups 50-54 (the largest single group) and 55-59 are now the largest two groups of people in the UK (source). And yet, the over 50s are treated by the marketers and a majority of brands like were suffering from incontinence and have no teeth. Im not struggling with any form of serious health decline or pondering my own death. I dont know about you but Im happy with who I am thanks  and really looking forward to the next fifteen years. In the UK, theres not much data about us, which always surprises me. In the US its different. The Harvard Business Review (source) reports that  portrayals of those over 50 are negative 28% of the time, compared to only 4% of the time for younger people. Seventy percent of the time, people in this demographic are shown in isolated situations  often seated, alone, with a partner, or with a medical professional where they were the recipients of care. In another American study, they found that although 46% of the U.S. adult population is age 50-plus, only 15% of online and marketing images containing adults include people this age (source). From what I can tell, its no different in the UK. Its not like were invisible. We drive the flashiest cars, have the finest clothes and accessories (by money spent) and a lot of us have a kitchen island. We mid-aged Brits buy more wine fridges per household than any country in continental Europe (source). This is because we drink more  whilst striving to enjoy ourselves more. Research (source) has found that, contrary to stereotypes, people over 50 are not set in their ways. The over 50s  are focused on anti-ageing and breaking the mould of what 50 looks like, researchers at California State University and Southern Connecticut State University wrote in a study published by the Journal of Behavioral Studies in Business (source). I dont see that as being any different in the UK. Contrary to the marketing images we all see, the average age of a car-buyer in the UK is 54. At Jaguar, it is 56, at BMW its 56 and Mercedes, its 54. In fact, the average age of a new Ford buyer is 56, for Volkswagen, it is 54, for Toyota, it is 63. Even cheap, fun, youngster-friendly Fiats are bought by people whose average age is 49. What a great time to be in tier 2 of life. Youre set to have more fun, have more choice and generally enjoy life, unlike any other generation before us or around us. Welcome to life after 50  statistically speaking  this is set to be the best time of your life."
187,"Today, those over 50 are an entirely new generation with more economic power than ever before. They have the energy and experience to get the most out of life and are now seriously defying the midlife cliche. In recent years, life, in general, has got more challenging for all sorts of reasons. The political and economic future is more fragile. In addition, there have been more political scandals and the deepest economic recessions in the last 20 years than in recorded British history. And we are on the verge of great change. The climate crisis is now recognised as exactly that  a crisis. The transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy will now be a big deal for all of us thanks to Russia. The talk all over the world is about designing future prospects  about de-coupling and de-globalisation, about reducing foreign dependence and bringing supply chains home and favouring domestic production and finance. Its also about how technology will accelerate, how algorithms will determine more of our lives and how employment will change. Today theres a growing and significant proportion of the population over the age of 50. In fact, 38 per cent are now in this demographic (source) in the UK today. And whilst many are trying to juggle work, family and their own lives they now have one eye on the realisation that retirement is on the horizon or rapidly approaching. Defying the midlife cliché Those in their 50s and 60s are not the same as the generation before them. Most people are healthier, more active, more alive in their skins than ever before and are now defying clichéd representations of so-called later life. Not only does this exciting group of people hold about 80 per cent of the UKs wealth  and have the highest level of disposable income, they are picking up new hobbies, setting up new businesses, travelling and seeking out new experiences. And far from winding down and resigning themselves to a life of gardening and daytime TV, they are internet savvy, unafraid to use new technology and ready to make the most of life. To challenge this cliched representation, it helps to know some interesting numbers. For instance, the average age of the new car buyer is in the mid-50s (source). A third of all businesses in Britain are owned by the over 50s. Half of the over 50s nowadays are having sex only marginally behind those half our age (source)  but youd never believe that looking at advertising on television, in the newspapers or in magazines. The over 50s now have more impact and influence on the UK economy than ever before. In 2016, this group spent more money than the younger generation for the first time in history  spending £376 billion on things such as food, entertainment and clothes. A whopping 62% of over 50s now aim to spend their savings, with fewer people believing that leaving an inheritance to their children is a priority (source). The bank of mum and dad has entrenched a feeling that midlife is now to be exploited and enjoyed. And many in midlife do not have large families like the generations before them, making them less financially obligated  assuming they are not looking after ageing parents of course. This lively demographic is an entirely new generation of people wanting the finer things in life, with the time and money to enjoy. Those in midlife are also increasingly becoming politically more powerful as data shows this age group also vote more than any other."
188,"We all know we need to be as secure online as we are anywhere. We all know that cybercrime has been increasing every year  but in the last twelve months of the pandemic  cybercrime rose by 31 per cent. The most common type of cybercrime attack was hacking through email or social media, which accounted for 53% of attacks over the year. Scams caused by the hacking of business computer servers was revealed as the second most common type of attack on businesses over the 12 month period. In terms of losses, people and companies based in London took the brunt of cybercrime, with the West Midlands, the South-East and the South-West following behind. Sarah Knowles, Senior Security Consultant at Nexor said: The last six months have opened up many opportunities for malicious hackers to intercept individuals and businesses as we have been thrown out of our usual routines and away from reliable systems. Across the country, millions of people switched to work from home and for many businesses, this left the door ajar as cybersecurity took a back seat with such short notice. The problem is that the criminals would prefer to use cybercrime than other forms of crime and are now attacking home addresses as they know so many people are actually at home and working from there. There has been an enormous upswing of online activity from home  and so this is where much of the targeting by cybercriminals now focuses its attention. Having said all that, the fact is  cybercrime is worse than you think. The actual scale of digitally enabled crime in the UK is dramatically under-reported, new statistics indicate. According to estimates compiled by the Office for National Statistics, there were 4.4 million fraud offences in the 12 months to 30 September 2020. But police-recorded offences collated through the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) via Action Fraud, Cifas and UK Finance, showed just 16.6% of frauds are being reported (source). That means online fraud offences are something like five times worse than we are being warned about. It also means your chances of being caught up in one is really quite a lot higher than you might think. First  The Basics The government produces its own recommendations when it comes to online cybercrime security via the National Cyber Security Centre. These basic tips are really the minimum standard you should be doing to protect your household from malicious cyberattacks that could end in identity fraud and/or financial loss, along with a whole host of other, no less stressful outcomes. If you are not doing all of these things, you are not safe and weaknesses will be found. Top tips from the National Cyber Security Centre: are Protect your email by using a strong and separate password Cybercriminals can use your email to access many of your personal accounts, leaving you vulnerable to identity theft. Install the latest software and app updates Software and app updates contain vital security updates to help protect your devices from cyber crime. Turn on two-factor authentication on your email Two-factor authentication is recommended for email accounts to make sure your data is secure. Password managers: how they help you secure passwords Using a password manager can help you create and remember passwords. Secure smartphones and tablets with a screen lock Screen locks offer your devices an important extra layer of security. Always back up your most important data Safeguard your most important data, such as your photos and key documents, by backing them up to an external hard drive or a cloud-based storage system. Working From Home BusinessFirstOnline makes a simple recommendation when it comes to working from home. Have a Device Dedicated to Work. They say: Mixing work and personal life are ill-advised, and the same goes for devices. When remote working, always make sure that work is being done on devices dedicated to work instead of using personal devices. The reason for this is that personal devices could be compromised. Plus, theres always the risk of a remote worker losing their personal device, putting the company in possible jeopardy. When possible, companies should hand out work devices to all remote workers. Remote workers should then do all of their work on said device (source). Banking Online  Minimum habits Here are some more basics you should do (full resource source here). Dont re-use the same passwords for different accounts. Use a strong password. Avoid passwords made up of common words, numbers or keyboard patterns (such as password or 123456), and dont include personal information, such as your name, date of birth, or any family members details. Read more about password security in this guide. Never share your full password or PIN number. Banks will never ask for your full PIN or password  instead, they will ask for specific numbers or letters, for example, the first and third character from your password. Always log out of your online banking session, especially if you use a device that others have access to. Be cautious when using a public computer to access your online banking, for example, library computers. They may not have the right level of security software. Ask the library staff for more information. Only use secure Wi-Fi networks to access your online banking. Dont use public networks, such as those in cafes or train stations  it may be possible for people on the same network to access your details. Check your balance and transactions regularly, and report anything you dont recognise to your bank. Regularly check that your personal details are correct and up to date. Beware of Scams A common scam is where fraudsters call up, telling you your account has been hacked and to move money to a safe account. They can even use technology that makes it look like theyre phoning from the banks official number. Your bank will never phone you out of the blue, asking for your PIN number or password, and they wont ask you to transfer money to a different account. The Royal Mail is used in so many scams that it has a specific section on its website to help people detect and report fraudulent messages. That service has been especially busy recently after people received emails and texts supposedly from the Royal Mail demanding a shipping payment. The Royal Mail also warned customers about similar scams delivered by text. This method of attack is particularly dangerous because its less common and people are therefore less likely to be alert to the threat. Furthermore, both legitimate and fraudulent texts are typically very short  perhaps one or two sentences. As such, recipients have little information to determine the authenticity of the message, and they may be tempted to follow the link to find out more. Texts also make it easier for scammers to hide their identity. They dont need to replicate official logos or the senders address, and the messages come from a nondescript phone number. However, in most cases, you can find out where the phone number is registered by looking it up online. If you are ever in any doubt whether a message is genuine, you should contact the Royal Mail by visiting its website (never follow a link from an email or text) or your local delivery office. If you are unsure visit the Royal Mail website here and you can check out any parcel or delivery. Buying online If youre planning on buying from a website youve never used before or havent heard of, check its reviews online and run the address through Googles Safe Browsing tool to check for security threats. In fact, you can use this tool for any website. Dont forget to type in www first and make sure you have the correct details for an instant result. Britains National Cyber Security Centre has lost of advice which you can read HERE  but the basics are: If possible  type a website address that you trust directly into the address bar  not the search bar. Use a credit card rather than a debit card. Use PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay. Using these platforms to authorise your payments means the retailer doesnt even see your payment details. They also provide their own dispute resolution should anything go wrong. However, they may not provide the same protection as a card provider, so check their terms and conditions before your sign up. When its time to pay for your items, check theres a closed padlock icon in the browsers address bar. It will look like this: locked padlock on a URL bar in browser Only provide enough details to complete your purchase. If possible, dont create an account for the online store when making your payment. You can usually complete your purchase without having to create an account We live in a digital age  and so its up to you to keep safe. You already have security habits such as locking the front and back doors, making sure window locks are secure and that your car is locked and so on  now do the same online to make sure you are not a victim of cybercrime."
190,"In 1841 the average newborn girl in Britain was not expected to see her 43rd birthday. Thankfully times have changed and so have life expectancies in the 170 years since the UKs first lifetable was constructed and theres good reason to think about the fact youll probably reach an older age than you think. The information contained in the Decennial Life Tables release, produced every 10 years, provides a fascinating insight into those changes, spanning seventeen decades. The low life expectancies of the 19th century can be explained by the higher number of infant deaths. Survival past the first year of life was historically a predominant factor in life expectancies and once a child had reached five years of age, he or she was much more likely to reach a greater age. So why am I telling you all this? Well, theres something else about life expectancy we should all consider  and that is  that we are likely to live longer than we might think. There are around 600 million people over the age of 60 across the globe  this is about 8.5 per cent. And astonishingly, this figure which is expected to double by 2025, according to the United Nations. When I was born in 1960, my life expectancy at the time was 67. By the time I was a teenager, most people died within a decade of retiring and middle-aged people were already looking tired and old by the time they were 40. By the time I reached the grand age of 50, my life expectancy was now 78. And a decade later, it is now officially 81.2 years. However, on this basis, for every four and a half years I keep going  theoretically, I get to live another year. So by the time, Im 80, I should expect to live to 87. And if I get to 87, I should just about get to 88. However, if I get to 85 in the first place  statistically, I get to live even longer because I move out of the category of average and join a growing band of oldies who reach 90.8 years. For instance  the Office for National Statistics confirms a number of little gems that we should all be aware of. There were more than half a million people aged 90 and over living in the UK in 2014, almost triple the number thirty years earlier. For every 100 people aged 90 and over in 2014, 29 were male and 71 were female The number of centenarians (people aged 100 and over) living in the UK has risen by 72% over the last decade to 14,450 in 2014. Male life expectancy has increased from 70.8 in 1980-82 to 79.1 in 2012-14. Female life expectancy has increased from 76.8 to 82.8 during the same period. The most common age of death was 86 years for men and 89 years for women. This is higher than the current average life expectancy at birth. Men aged 85 in 2012-14 could expect to live to 90.8 whereas women could expect to live to 91.8. Three in 10 of those aged 80 and over reported being lonely in 2014 to 2015. A third of those over 80 reported very high levels of life satisfaction in 2014 to 2015. Around 1 in 10 (11%) of those aged 75 and over reported having no close friends in 2011 to 2012. The league table of centenarians places Britain at a reasonable 13th position with 21.5 people per 100,000 population. The top slots are held by Japan, South Korea and much to my surprise Barbados. In Europe  Portugal, France, Italy and Spain are ahead of us Brits in 4th, 6th, 7th and 12th position respectively. The point being  youd better prepare for a longer life and older age than you might have first thought."
192,"Labour has vowed to prioritise companies paying full UK tax over those registered in offshore tax havens when awarding government contracts, openDemocracy can reveal. At the partys annual conference, Labour announced plans to reduce procurement contracts going to tax-avoiding firms if elected, after research by the Fair Tax Foundation revealed that one in six contracts issued by Conservative governments between 2014 and 2019 had tax-haven links. Policy details seen by openDemocracy shed light on how the party plans to implement greater tax transparency, with a companys tax status being taken into account when agreeing procurement contracts. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner told openDemocracy that companies receiving contracts would be expected to make commitments to shun tax avoidance and not be registered in tax havens Firms would also be expected to be open about whether they pay full UK taxes. Rayner told openDemocracy that the policy will promote truth and transparency. It is understood that public bodies would still be able to choose to contract companies that are not fully transparent in their tax declarations, but more information would be available for them to make those decisions. Labours proposals also include urging multinational corporations that secure government contracts to provide tax information on a country-by-country basis, declaring information such as revenue, profit, taxes paid, employee numbers and assets in each country they are registered in. While global companies like Apple or Amazon have received widespread criticism for registering profits in countries with lower corporation tax, other lesser-known brands that are contracted by UK local authorities  such as elderly care providers  have been known to register profits overseas. The party would also use a publicly accessible digital dashboard to track all procurement contracts, as well as keeping a record of all suppliers and their beneficial ownership. Speaking to openDemocracy, Rayner said: While the Tories cut murky deals in the dark with their mates using taxpayers money, Labour will tender in the public interest, keep the receipts and publish them out in the open because the public deserves the truth and transparency about their taxes. Our contracts dashboard will finally ingrain honesty and openness into the heart of public spending, with transparent information about all contracts awarded and suppliers who fail to deliver. The more businesses that shun artificial tax avoidance, profit-shifting and tax havens, the more tax revenues there will be for public services in the UK The UK loses an estimated £17bn in corporation tax revenues as a result of profit-shifting alone when companies report their profit in a tax haven, according to the Fair Tax Foundation, a UK-based not-for-profit social enterprise that seeks to encourage businesses to pay the right amount of corporation tax at the right time and in the right place. Paul Monaghan, the Fair Tax Foundations chief executive, told openDemocracy that these policies would radically improve a local authoritys ability to do due diligence when outsourcing work. There is a growing movement of towns and cities across the UK that want to use their buying power to encourage responsible tax conduct and other social goods  and polling shows that this is supported by a large majority of the public, he said. The more businesses that shun artificial tax avoidance, profit-shifting and tax havens, the more tax revenues there will be for public services in the UK and across the rest of the world. Alex Dunnagan, acting director of think tank TaxWatch, told openDemocracy that, Labours proposal to increase the transparency of multinationals should be welcomed. In awarding government contracts its important that the public ultimately knows where their money is ending up. Dunnagan added: Tax non-compliance has been a potential ground for exclusion for government contracts for years, but the issue is enforcement. The Cabinet Office issued a note in 2013 requiring that companies bidding for government contracts declared any tax non-compliance. Following FOIs to over 40 government departments, [TaxWatch] found zero instances of companies declaring non-compliance."
193,"The governments attempts to assist Saudi Arabias controversial takeover of the British Premier League football team Newcastle United included a personal intervention by a Tory minister, documents obtained exclusively by openDemocracy have revealed. It appears to contradict Boris Johnsons claim in Parliament last year that the government had no involvement with the sale, which was heavily criticised due to Saudi Arabias record for human rights abuses. Correspondence released under the Freedom of Information Act shows that Lord Gerry Grimstone promised the Premier League he would secure a response from the highest levels of the Saudi government to the takeover plan. Grimstone, then the UKs investment minister, had asked the then Premier League chair Gary Hoffman in August 2020 to share the leagues legal advice on a way forward for the stalled takeover of the club by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), the documents reveal Grimstone, a former banker with high-level contacts in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, told Hoffman: I can then confirm from the highest levels of the Saudi [g]overnment whether this is deliverable and we all will then know where this stands. The documents show Grimstone liaising between the Premier League and UK government about a potential solution to the takeover, and promising to approach the Saudi government. The evidence of Grimstones efforts, in internal memos copying in Downing Street officials and the British ambassador in Saudi Arabia, Neil Crompton, further contradicts the UK governments repeated insistence that it had no involvement in the takeover process. In April 2021, Boris Johnson stated in a parliamentary answer to the Newcastle Central MP, Chi Onwurah: The government was not involved at any point in the takeover talks on the sale of Newcastle. Johnson had appointed Grimstone in March 2020. I can then confirm from the highest levels of the Saudi Government whether this is deliverable. Lord Grimstone Grimstones discussions to encourage the deal were first revealed in May this year. A DIT spokesperson at the time downplayed the ministers involvement, saying he never tried to influence Mr Hoffman and the Premier League to approve the Newcastle takeover. The spokesperson said Grimstone was only fulfilling his role to keep abreast of large investments potentially coming into the UK. The documents released by the DIT to openDemocracy consist of four memos Grimstone sent in August 2020 to Crompton and two unnamed officials in Downing Street, informing them of his contact with Hoffman, including WhatsApp messages and three phone calls. The DIT heavily redacted the memos before releasing them, claiming they could damage the UKs international relations or interests, and were commercially sensitive. But it is clear from the sections left unredacted that Grimstone was looking for a way for the takeover to be approved by the Premier League, and that the stalled process was seen as sensitive and potentially embarrassing for relations with Saudi Arabia. In the first memo, sent on 11 August 2020, Grimstone told Crompton he had just had a 45-minute call with Hoffman. We established clearly at the beginning of the call that my only role was to facilitate the passing of ideas between the EPL [English Premier League] and [Saudi] PIF and that in no way prejudiced the EPLs complete autonomy in this matter, Grimstone wrote. Hoffman told the minister that the Premier Leagues barrister had advised that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) had the power to control the PIF. That meant the Saudi state itself had to be cleared by the leagues fit and proper persons test for owners and directors. The next sections apparently set out Hoffmans explanation as to why that may have been a problem, but are all redacted. It is understood that the Saudis rejected that legal advice about state control of the PIF, and refused to submit to the owners and directors test. It was also believed that the Saudi state was likely to fail the test, resulting in the takeover being blocked. However, that was not because of the states notorious human rights abuses or the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which have made the takeover of Newcastle hugely controversial, but because of Saudi state pirating of Qatari-owned sports TV rights. Grimstone wrote in his memo: We then discussed possible ways to solve this conundrum. The possible solutions, set out in five separate columns, are redacted. Reporting a subsequent call with Hoffman on 22 August, Grimstone wrote: Gary said the EPL would like to find a solution and he is very sensitive to the wider considerations surrounding all this in respect of relationships with KSA. We agreed that any process should not restart until a clear way through is on the table as any new failure would be highly embarrassing. Grimstone wrote that Hoffman was going to contact the Premier Leagues barrister, and ask him to advise on is there a way forward [sic] and, if so, what undertakings would KSA have to give. The parties would then have a clear view on how high the hurdle is and whether they are prepared to jump it. Later the same day Grimstone sent a WhatsApp message to Hoffman: I think for all our sakes we need to try and bring this matter to a conclusion as quickly as possible. As discussed it would be helpful for you and I to have a view from your QC [barrister] as to what in his opinion it would take to achieve this. I can then confirm from the highest levels of the Saudi Government whether this is deliverable and we all will then know where this stands. Grimstone also offered to join in a discussion with the Premier Leagues barrister. The ministers own assessment of the governments intention, included at the end of the memo, was: Hopefully, we are helping to inject some clarity into a very muddled situation to allow the parties to bring this to the point of decision. Despite Grimstones efforts, the deal did not go through in 2020, as the legal advice never changed, and KSA refused to submit to the owners and directors test. In October 2021, however, the Premier League announced that a way through to approving the takeover had been found, as the PIF had provided legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United. Hoffman then told a meeting of the 20 Premier League clubs that the government had put pressure on the league to approve the takeover. Richard Masters, the leagues chief executive, told them it had not, however, and said in a BBC interview: There were conversations with government but there was no pressure applied. A Premier League source indicated that Masters maintains this view. My only role was to facilitate the passing of ideas between the PIF and EPL Lord Grimstone Grimstone today said he strongly rejected the conclusion that the documents show he had been working hard to facilitate the takeover, or that Johnsons statement to parliament was untrue. Part of my role as investment minister was to keep abreast of large investments potentially coming into the UK, he said. This was particularly important in investments such as Newcastle which were in the public domain and which were attracting a great deal of public interest. I made it very clear to Mr Hoffman that my only role was to facilitate the passing of ideas between the PIF and EPL and that in no way did I seek to prejudice the EPLs complete autonomy in this matter. Naturally, as I would with any high-profile investment coming into the UK, I was concerned that the parties resolved this between themselves courteously and professionally whatever the outcome of their discussions. Grimstone stepped down as a minister in July after Johnsons resignation, saying he had brought in getting on for £50bn in investment. That figure included £10bn deals each with sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Johnson did not respond to questions about his statement to parliament, but a DIT spokesperson said the government stood by all its previous statements. Hoffman, who told the clubs that he was not influenced by the government pressure, declined to comment."
196,"New Prime Minister Liz Truss has dominated headlines in recent weeks by claiming that workers outside of London need more graft. In a remarkable reheating of longstanding debates about Britains productivity puzzle during the Conservative leadership campaign, these comments have given new voice to concerns raised in a decade-old book that Truss co-authored with Conservative colleagues, which described British workers as the worst idlers in the world. Most recently, Jacob Rees-Mogg doubled-down in support of Truss comments, which dovetail with his own mission of getting the post-pandemic civil service back to the office. While there are certainly regional disparities in UK productivity, this trend results not from failings in individual work ethic but from path-dependent, institutional features of the British model of capitalism. These are shaped by decades of inadequate public policy, much of it pursued by Conservative governments including, despite his promise to turbo-charge the economy post-Brexit, the previous Boris Johnson administration. Fully appreciating these dynamics necessitates taking a more holistic view of the long-term drivers of productivity than is common in the issues academic, media, and political treatments. While weak productivity is a contemporary international phenomenon, the British case is particularly acute. The twentieth-century trend of UK productivity growth hovered reliably around 2.2% a year. From the mid-2000s, however, this figure cratered to between 0.3% and 1%. Such aggregate numbers mask a more nuanced picture of regional difference. As Truss alluded to, in London and the South East of England, productivity is higher than the British average, with the capitals statistics dwarfing those of the weakest region (Wales) by 63%. Several explanations have been offered for these patterns. As we have seen, Truss has lamented the insufficient skill and application of British workers, and the inadequate distribution of productive labour characteristics across the nation. Others have made cases for capital shallowing (where workers replace structures and equipment) and the declining creative destruction of unproductive firms (facilitated by poor technological innovation and diffusion and permissive monetary policy). UK economic managers, meanwhile, freely admit that no one really knows why the countrys twenty-first-century productivity is so poor. No single thesis fully captures the drivers of Britains disappointing productivity. Existing explanations are too narrow and miss the multifaceted politics behind recent trends. Taken together, however, several factors can help us to better understand the so-called productivity puzzle. The dominance of Finance With its roots in imperial economic patterns, Londons longstanding status as a leading financial centre has provided significant fuel for Britains regional productivity differences. British industry has not benefitted proportionally from the Citys status, and limited state intervention through industrial and regional development policies has meant no substantive regeneration in former industrial heartlands. High-end financial and business services account for the majority of British exports, with such highly productive frontier firms disproportionately concentrated in the economically prosperous South. Meanwhile, a lower-skilled, domestically-oriented service sector economy characterises the rest of Britain, which lags behind. Labour Market Fragilities and Imbalances Finances dominance in British capitalism has distorting effects on the labour market. The financial sector wage premium is disproportionately high in Britain, at 45%. University graduates are the typical beneficiaries of this well-paid work, mostly located in London and South East England. They are also much more likely to receive bonus payments than those working in the wider economy, exacerbating trends toward acute inequality. Decades of underperforming education and training infrastructures, alongside flexible labour market policies have created the low skill, low wage, precarious employment rut the UK labour market finds itself in. The majority of the British labour market comprises low productivity service sector work, characterised by precarity, limited training opportunities and low remuneration. Government active labour market policies are strongly geared towards making workers available for any (low-quality) job, rather than investing in human capital or upskilling. The British economy prioritises a shareholder value logic favouring ever-freer capital and labour markets, and minimal hiring and firing restrictions. These factors arguably restrict the path to higher productivity growth, helping to explain the predominance of low value-added service sector jobs at the expense of higher skills and higher value-added production. Insufficient public investment The common thread underpinning each of the previous productivity problems is the long-term lack of well-targeted public investment. Successive governments have proved unwilling to pursue more interventionist or directive upskilling measures to assist the economys transition towards high-end exports. Despite increased investment in education from the 1990s, ongoing labour market liberalisation designed to facilitate the knowledge economy only exacerbated the divergence between high- and low-productivity firms. The British states built-in antipathy to public investment and lack of strategic support for manufacturing industries has further productivity implications. British capital is historically short-termist rather than focused on long-term productive investment. For over two decades since 1997, Britain has had the lowest levels of Gross Fixed Capital Formation  a measure of investment in non-financial public and private sector assets  of any OECD nation. R&D investment in Britain is also much lower than European and OECD averages. These trends mean that Britain has long lacked the kind of expenditure that is essential for developing high-end production. Conclusion Exposing the politics of Britains productivity puzzle highlights the prejudicial nature of Truss comments. Any analysis that foregrounds the supposed laziness of British workers only serves to let politicians, institutions, and the state off the hook. Capitalism, after all, is shaped by institutional context and public policy, including regional (under)investment, skills, and education policies, and is embedded in distinct social contexts, sustained by specific institutional infrastructures. Britains productivity puzzle reflects not individual failings of often-disadvantaged workers, but structurally embedded dysfunctionalities in Britains model of capitalism and the politics that upholds it."
197,"Theres no Magic Money Tree, Theresa May famously told nurses desperate for a pay rise in 2017. But the ex-prime minister failed to mention that there is a Magic Money Stream  along which billions of pounds flow from privatised UK firms, like the utilities, to the global elite. Take Englands water companies, which have paid out £18.9bn in dividends since 2010, including £1.1bn in the past year, to shareholders across the globe. Among those profiting off the firms  which this week left beaches across England strewn in sewage  are Bermuda-registered investment house Lazards, China, foreign sovereign wealth funds, and Malaysian corporation YTL. This money has to come from somewhere. When the water companies were privatised in the 1980s, the British government paid off all of their long-term debts  at a cost of more than £7bn. Since then, the companies have borrowed tens of billions of pounds against peoples future water bills in order to pipe cash to their owners, sometimes leaving the companies so indebted that they struggle to borrow to fund actual infrastructure As credit rating agency Moodys put it last year, the high level of gearing at Thames Water and other debt in the group constrains its credit rating. Meanwhile, bills have soared and investment in infrastructure has fallen. Scottish Water, on the other hand, remained nationalised after a 1994 referendum held by Strathclyde regional council showed overwhelming support for public ownership. Here, bills have remained steady for 17 years, while infrastructure investment is a third higher than in England. And I can still enjoy swimming in the sea. As one former water industry insider told me, Englands firms specialise less in actually delivering water infrastructure and more in finding ways to extract as much cash as possible from the business through complex financial engineering. Skim through the backgrounds of the companies board members and youll find more experts in financial engineering than civil engineering. That is  if you can navigate your way to the actual owners, who, as my industry contact put it, have encircled themselves in holding companies upon holding companies upon holding companies in order to take on as much debt as possible and then funnel it into dividends rather than investing in the assets. And thats before we talk about the overpaid bosses. It must be the easiest job in corporate Britain  you cant lose customers; it has an inflation escalator built in, said my source. Its not surprising that many of them hold lucrative second jobs on other companies boards. As well as pumping sewage into Englands seas, these firms are pumping cash from the wages of English people and into the pockets of some of the worlds richest people and companies. And its not just the water industry. It makes me even more fuming While Royal Mail workers plan to strike over a below-inflation pay offer, their bosses are preparing to pay out millions to a Czech billionaire whos the biggest single importer of Russian gas into the European Union. Daniel K?etínskýs Luxembourg-based investment firm owns more than a fifth of Royal Mail shares and will be the main beneficiary of a £133m dividend pay-out by the company on 6 September. Shareholders also got a £200m payout in January, as the company raked in an adjusted operating profit of £750m. K?etínský is the CEO of central Europes largest energy group, Energetický a pr?myslový, and a significant media mogul in Czechia. The notoriously secretive Swiss bank UBS, the second biggest shareholder, will also get millions. Royal Mails boss got a £140,000 bonus in June as part of a £753,000 pay offer. That just makes me even more fuming, said one local postie who always smiles and waves at my toddler daughter when hes doing his rounds when I told him about Royal Mails dividend plans and who would benefit. And so it should. The maximum base wage for a postie outside London is around £23,500 a year. With inflation running above 10%, the proposed 5.5% pay rise means these frontline workers are being rewarded for their long pandemic slog with a real terms wage cut of nearly 5%, as the wealth they produce is funnelled to Luxembourgish and Swiss bank accounts. It is at least the public that is benefitting from UK rail profits  primarily the public in Europe Youve gotta do what youve gotta do, said another friendly postie, one of our familys pandemic heroes, when I asked him about the strike. 5.5 per cent wont wash. Like 97.1 per cent of the Communication and Workers Unions Royal Mail members, he voted in favour of a series of strikes in the coming weeks. Or, look at the trains  which have spent much of the summer stationary as workers strike to stop companies from slashing wages and staff (including those who are needed for basic safety) while profits from soaring fares are whizzed rapidly abroad. In this case, it is at least the public that is benefitting  primarily the public in Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Chiltern and Cross Country railways are ultimately owned by Deutsche Bahn, and so the German government, which slashed fares on all city and regional public to 9 a month over the summer. No such luck for their British customers, who can expect train fares to increase again in January. Meanwhile, Greater Anglia and the East and West Midlands Railways are ultimately owned by Nederlandse Spoorwegen, a Dutch state-owned rail company  which made a 377m pre-tax profit on its UK franchises last year. A Nederlandse Spoorwegen train from Amsterdam to Groningen, 200 kilometres to the northeast, currently costs £25. A London to Norwich ticket  also 200 kilometres to the north-east, also on a Nederlandse Spoorwegen train  costs £60. C2C, which runs train services between Essex and London, and Avanti Westcoast are ultimately owned by the Italian state-owned rail company Trenitalia. A train from London to Southend  66 kilometres away  currently costs £14. A train from Rome to Latina  a distance of about 73 kilometres  costs around £5. And, in my experience, Italian trains are significantly more luxurious. In October, First Group, which owns Great Western Railways, South Western Railways and the Transpennine Express, offered shareholders £500m in a buy-back scheme, and earlier this year, they paid out £8.2m in dividends, by my sums. The companys biggest shareholder is the New York-based private equity firm Coast Capital. A perfect storm of inequality This great British rip-off, which is hitting the fan after 40 years, has been met with a surge in prices caused by the current omni-crisis. Climate change is destroying crops, while Russias invasion of Ukraine has damaged the output of two of the worlds biggest grain producers and delivered a jump in gas prices. The lifting of COVID lockdowns has delivered a surge in demand, which has hit a bottleneck in the worlds fleet of just 5,500 container ships, record numbers of which have been abandoned by unscrupulous owners in recent years. Brexit means costs for importers. But, while customs checks at British borders add to the cost of importing from Europe, the devastation of Ukraines fields doesnt make it more expensive for US food giant Cargill to grow wheat on the Great Plains. It just means theres less flour to go around, so the firm can charge more for its wheat and see profits rise  which has helped three members of the Cargill family to join the worlds rich list this year. Restrictions on Russian oil dont make it more expensive for Shell, BP or the Saudis to pump theirs. It just means they can demand higher prices. Shells share price is up 35% since 1 January, BPs, 30%. In May, Saudi Aramco replaced Apple as the biggest company in the world. The solution isnt complex: ensure companies pay their profits to those who create their wealth Rents are up by 12%, not because its suddenly more expensive to let someone live in your spare house, but because, post-pandemic, lots of people are moving out of family bubbles. Amid a surge in demand, landlords have discovered they can charge more. More and more often, those landlords are super-wealthy overseas investors, hundreds of thousands of whom took advantage of the post-Brexit crash in the value of the pound to buy up British property. Energy prices are soaring, but power station and refinery workers are seeing wages shrink and have been forced to take fortnightly industrial action across the UK. The Tories used to say government debt was the biggest problem facing the country. If they really thought that, theyd encourage wages to rise with prices. The money the Treasury owes is denominated in sterling, so if the cost of each pound dips and the total number of pounds coming through the door in taxes rises, then the debt evaporates like a fish pond in a greenhouse. For all the wibble about cutting spending, inflation is the main way governments have dealt with debt over the centuries. On its own, inflation is good for everyone in debt and bad for everyone with savings, meaning its basic effect is to redistribute wealth from rich to poor. Capitalists hate it because it erodes the value of capital, but anyone sitting on a pile of debt should be pleased. The problems come when wages fail to keep pace with prices, driving up the cost of living for people who rely on selling their labour to survive, crashing millions into poverty. The solution isnt that complex: support workers to organise, ensure companies pay the profit from their rising prices to those who create their wealth, not their usually wealthy, often overseas owners. But the Conservative Party is doing the exact opposite. For years, its ministers waged war on trade union rights, making it harder and harder for workers to win pay rises. Now, they are denouncing those pushing for wages to keep pace with prices, instead calling for restraint. Lets at least be honest about what theyre doing. Tory Britain is being asset stripped  and we are all paying the price."
199,"Nearly half (49 per cent) of social workers say they are less likely to stay in their jobs due to excessive workloads, exacerbated by high stress levels and low morale. A new survey by UNISON found that 93 per cent of social workers had warned that staff shortages were affecting their ability to do their job, with 90 per cent highlighting unmanageable caseloads as a key concern. Nine out of ten (89 per cent) of social workers also said they were worried about the level of service they are able to provide to the public, with three-quarters (78 per cent) saying they have experienced increased stress levels. Many reported they have faced threats of violence at work, with 44 per cent believing harassment and abuse have increased during the pandemic. Unacceptable levels of pressure on social work teams will end up costing lives, warned Christina McAnea, UNISON general secretary. The safety of vulnerable children, adults and their families must be paramount and that can only be achieved with a strong and valued workforce. Social workers skills and interventions keep people safe from harm and change lives. But there simply arent enough of them to deal with increasing demand. New recruits and experienced workers are at breaking point and are leaving the profession in their droves."
