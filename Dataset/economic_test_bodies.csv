34,"Technology stocks led a broad rally on Wall Street Friday, capping another strong week for the market, as investors welcomed solid profits from Apple and other companies. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% and posted its first back-to-back weekly gains since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9%. Smaller company stocks also gained ground, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 2.3%. Apple's latest quarterly results showed the iPhone maker made even fatter profits during the summer than expected. Its shares rose 7.6% and led a rally in technology stocks that had largely been beat up a day earlier. Intel jumped 10.7% after delivering much bigger profit than analysts forecasted even though it said it saw worsening economic conditions. Gilead Sciences soared 12.9%, and T-Mobile US gained 7.4% after they also topped Wall Street's profit expectations. Investors were also encouraged by a report on consumer spending that came a day after new data showing the economy grew modestly in the third quarter and inflation eased. ""You have an economy that almost refuses to keel over, an economy that at its core is resilient, but a the same time inflation is easing and that is what the Fed wants and that's obviously what the market wants, said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. That's helped fuel hopes on Wall Street for a pivot by the Federal Reserve, where the central bank dials down the big interest-rate hikes that have shaken the market. Such a move could boost the market, though many analysts say such hopes may be overdone. The central bank has been very clear about its plan to err on the side of going too far in order to tame inflation, which means the big gains on hopes of a pullback seem premature, said Liz Young, chief investment strategist at SoFi. This rally has now gotten a bit irrational and fragile at this level, Young said. The S&P 500 rose 93.76 points to 3,901.06. The Dow gained 828.52 points to 32,861.80. The Nasdaq rose 309.78 points to 11,102.45. The Russell 2000 gained 40.60 points to 1,846.92. Many big U.S. companies have been reporting stronger earnings than expected, though the bag remains decidedly mixed. Solid earnings on Friday helped to offset a 6.8% drop for Amazon, which offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for upcoming revenue. It was the latest Big Tech company to take a beating this week after reporting some discouraging trends. It's a sharp turnaround after the group dominated Wall Street for years with seemingly unstoppable growth. Earlier in the week, Meta Platforms lost nearly a quarter of its value after reporting a second straight quarter of revenue decline amid falling advertising sales and stiff competition from TikTok. Microsoft and Google's parent company also reported slowdowns in key areas. Such woes have created a sharp split on Wall Street this week, between lagging Big Tech stocks and the rest of the market. The Nasdaq, which is stuffed with high-growth tech stocks, notched a 2.2% gain this week. It would have had an even worse showing if not for Apple's boost from Friday. The Dow, meanwhile, jumped 5.7% for the week because it has less of an emphasis on tech. Rising interest rates have hit Big Tech stock prices harder than the rest of the market, and the pressure increased Friday as yields climbed. The markets still seem to not want to believe that we might end up in a place where an earnings recession is possible, Young said. Data released in the morning showed the raises that U.S. workers got in wages and other compensation during the summer was in line with economists expectations. That should keep the Fed on track to keep hiking rates sharply in hopes of weakening the job market enough to undercut the nations high inflation. Other data showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation remains very high, and U.S. households continue to spend more in the face of it. The Fed is trying to starve inflation of the purchases made by households and businesses needed to keep it high. It's doing that by intentionally slowing the economy and the jobs market. The worry is that it could go too far and cause a sharp downturn. The Fed has already raised its benchmark overnight interest rate up to a range of 3% to 3.25% up from virtually zero in March. The widespread expectation is for it to push through another increase that's triple the usual size next week, before it potentially makes a smaller increase in December. Higher rates not only slow the economy, they also hurt prices for stocks and other investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.42% from 4.28% late Thursday. The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and many other loans, climbed to 4.01% from 3.93%. Trading in Twitter's stock has ended, after Elon Musk took control of the company following a lengthy legal battle."
119,"The first working week of the fourth quarter brings a mound of trepidation for the markets and global economy. The third quarter ended on a sour note, with the U.S. market off nearly 25% for the year, as measured by the S&P 500. Globally, new British Prime Minister Liz Truss was forced into an embarrassing U-turn on her Reaganomics policy of tax cuts for the rich, while oil producing nations are considering a production cut to boost prices following the recent sharp sell-off on fears of a global economic slowdown. In the U.S., questions are being asked about the Federal Reserves hawkish policy of raising interest rates to inflict pain on consumers and businesses alike as bond yields surge, stocks crater and the housing sector heads into a tailspin. A measure of inflation the Fed follows closely rose in August from July even as the Fed hiked interest rates by 75 basis points in three consecutive moves. Then there is the devastating loss of life and property from Hurricane Ian, with the death toll at 87 already and estimates of damage topping $100 billion. President Joe Biden will visit Florida on Wednesday, but the storm also hit the Carolinas this weekend where four of the 87 died. He will also visit Puerto Rico on Monday. And, to add insult to injury, there are real concerns about Russia as it suffers humiliating losses in its war against Ukraine and as President Vladimir Putin rattles the nuclear saber. The year of geopolitics is coming to a crescendo in the fourth quarter, BCA Research warned Friday in its latest geopolitical survey. The investment firm focused on what it considers the overriding themes driving the global outlook: great power rivalry, hypo-globalization, and populism/nationalism. These are playing out with Russias proxy war with NATO, the Russia-EU economic divorce, the fourth Taiwan Strait crisis, and the looming crisis with Iran, BCA says. The end result is unstable markets and a rush to safe havens such as the U.S. dollar, now up 16% this year against the worlds other major currencies. A strong dollar wreaks havoc with corporate earnings for U.S. companies that have a large percentage of foreign sales while making it more expensive for economies outside the U.S. to export their goods and pay for commodities that are priced in dollars. The dollars rise is a direct result of the Feds interest rate policies. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has insisted he will continue raising rates until inflation is quelled and the out of balance labor market returns to a more normal state even at the expense of a recession. So far, the higher rates the Fed has engineered have had a measurable effect in some quarters of the economy, crushing the inflated values in the stock market and leaving pending home sales 24% below where they were a year ago. But the labor market has yet to buckle. This week brings a slew of readings on the current state of the jobs environment. Tuesday will bring a report on job openings for the end of August with expectations of a slight drop from July, but still 11 million open positions or about two for every potential worker. On Wednesday, private payroll firm ADP will issue its September survey of hiring, with 200,000 new jobs expected to be added after Augusts 132,000 increase. On Thursday, there will be another weekly report on filings for unemployment benefits following last weeks 193,000, a number that hardly suggests a weak job market. Then Friday comes the big number, the September jobs report from the Labor Department. Economists expect a number of around 250,000, but the reports have been surprisingly good of late and even the forecast number is one that would be considered good in normal times. Economists at Wells Fargos corporate and investment banking group project a jobs number of 275,000. While still healthy, our call is well below the 438K YTD and nearly 800K post-pandemic averages as labor market gains are continuing to slow in response to tighter monetary policy, they wrote Sunday. That said, business surveys continue to point to a labor market that is still positive and running at a pace that is still above a sustainable run-rate given labor force growth and population trends. We look for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.7% and for average hourly earnings to continue at a similar pace to what we have seen so far this year  rising 0.4% m/m (5.1% yr/yr). That would still reflect a tight labor market and one with wage pressures inconsistent with inflation coming back down to target, the bank said. Notably, Fridays job number will be the last before the Feds November meeting of its monetary policy group where experts see another interest rate hike of magnitude. Given developments overseas and the unpredictable nature of Russias Putin or Chinas Xi Jinping, theres nothing to suggest the beginning of the fourth quarter will bring anything but more frayed nerves on Wall and Main Streets."
8,"India is expected to surpass its tax collection goal by more than 2 trillion rupees ($24.3 billion) in the current fiscal year, according to two officials with knowledge on the matter. Strong revenue receipts is giving Prime Minister Narendra Modis government leeway to contain the budget deficit within 6.4% of gross domestic product amid a ballooning subsidy bill, said the two officials. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Steady collections and measures to reduce tax evasion are helping bolster revenue against a target of 19.34 trillion rupees, they said. The government will likely collect this financial year an additional 300 billion-400 billion rupees from windfall tax imposed on export of some fuels and local production of crude oil from July, the officials said. The states increasing income puts it on track to further narrow the budget deficit in the year ending March 2023 from a record 9.2% of GDP during the first year of the pandemic while sustaining Modis free food program, fertilizer subsidies and other inflation-busting measures. Indias improving tax collections will also help counter sluggish state asset sales, the officials said. The government has only sold about a third of the 650 billion rupees worth of assets targeted for divestment. Indias union budget, due to be presented in February, will outline the federal spending plan for the coming fiscal year. Its always a closely-watched event, and especially amid the challenges facing Asias third-largest economy including slowing growth and elevated inflation."
161,"When it comes to the economy  not much is going well right now. Londons FTSE 100 Index fell on Tuesday as data showed some signs of reduced demand for labour. It was healthcare and consumer goods stocks pulling the market down the most. Of course, some healthcare stocks rose rapidly in the pandemic and are now falling back and consumer goods are doing the same as savings wither and sentiment about the cost of living drives a stake through the heart of optimism built up late last year. Rolls-Royce took a hit as it dropped to the bottom of the blue-chip index on brokerage action because it slumped 6.4% after JP Morgan downgraded the aero engineers stock to underweight from neutral. The optics dont look good for the markets do they? The FTSE 100 (FTSE) dropped 0.9%, with Unilever (ULVR.L), Diageo (DGE.L), HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) down between 1.2% and 2.6%, while the domestically focused midcap FTSE 250 index (FTMC) declined 0.9%. While official figures showed Britains jobless rate fell below its level immediately before the coronavirus pandemic, the employment rose by a weaker-than-expected 10,000. But the real thing to keep an eye on is job vacancies. It hit a record high in the three months to March and many, including the Bank of England, are looking for signs that the lack of candidates to fill jobs will push up wages to the extent that it risks a wage-price spiral. In other words  yet more inflation! Inflation data from the US may well see interest rates being pushed up higher  which is to be expected. The global impact of the Russia/Ukraine war has still been fully felt yet and the pandemic is still not over as some countries, especially those with zero-Covid policies are now finding out. The mood is sombre in just about every market there is. But not all, of course."
7,"By PTI: Amid rupee sliding below 64 to a dollar, global agency Standard & Poor's today said it will maintain negative outlook for the country as currency depreciation is adversely impacting investor confidence. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India... We maintain a negative outlook on India's BBB- sovereign credit ratings,"" S&P Senior Director Sovereign and International Public Finance Ratings (Asia-Pacific) Kim Eng Tan said in an emailed statement. 'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade and a downgrade would mean pushing the country's sovereign rating to junk status, making overseas borrowings by corporates costlier. Referring to the recent measures announced by the government to restrict capital outflow, Tan said these ""have also increased uncertainties among investors both foreign and domestic"". ""If the uncertainty continues, business financing conditions could deteriorate further and investment growth could slow further"". In order to tame the sliding Rupee, the Reserve Bank and the government had on August 14 announced stern measures, including curbs on Indian firms investing abroad and on outward remittances by resident Indians. S&P's comments come on a day when the rupee touched the record low of 64.11 to a dollar in intra-day trade today. Moody's Investor's Service in its report today said the depreciating rupee is likely to inflate the fuel subsidy bill, weaken the credit quality of oil companies and put pressure on the fiscal deficit. Earlier in May S&P had warned that it may downgrade India's sovereign rating to junk grade if the government fails to pursue reforms and check deterioration in fiscal and current account deficits. S&P said its future credit rating action would depend upon the response of policymakers to the latest economic developments. India's long term growth prospects could weaken on a sustained basis, with negative implications for the sovereign credit fundamentals, it said. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India. We believe this to be a result of the declining economic growth in the past two years and what some investors view as insufficient long-term policy response that could reverse the decline and revive investments,"" S&P said. It added that investments continue to be stifled by inadequate infrastructure, rigidities in labour and product markets, and red tape, among other issues. A sliding rupee, which is mainly on account of widening Current Account Deficit (CAD), will make imports costlier and fuel subsidy bill. The CAD, which is the difference between the inflow and outflow of foreign currency, had touched a record high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 fiscal. Finance Minister P Chidambaram last week said that CAD will be contained at USD 70 billion or 3.7 per cent in the current fiscal and it is a red line which will not be breached. Moody's has said despite previous price liberalisation in the petroleum sector, the subsidy bill is likely to rise due to depreciation, thus widening the government's deficit, which is also under pressure from slower revenue growth. ""We believe the currency will remain under pressure until the current account deficit narrows meaningfully, or capital inflows accelerate due to an improving growth outlook,"" Moody's said."
128,"The secretive think tanks behind more than a dozen campaign pledges of Liz Truss have proposed cost-of-living solutions including scrapping childcare regulations, abandoning net zero, allowing AI to diagnose patients and abolishing the energy price cap altogether. Between them, the Truss-backed think tanks have also lobbied against a windfall tax on gas and oil companies, called for a windfall tax on renewables firms instead, and urged ministers to cut taxes rather than provide further support for those who will struggle with soaring bills this winter. Analysis by openDemocracy has identified a string of Truss policies and campaign staff originating from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), the Adam Smith Institute and the Centre for Policy Studies. MPs and campaigners have raised the alarm about Trusss closeness to the groups, saying a government led by the Conservative frontrunner would be a puppet for the organisations Truss is particularly close to the IEA, having founded its parliamentary wing FREER in 2011 and hired its former communications director to run her campaign. Her policies to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax, crack down on the right to strike, review inheritance tax, loosen financial solvency regulation and deregulate the childcare sector were all first proposed by the IEA. None of the think tanks discloses its funders, but the IEA has received donations from BP and ExxonMobil and, along with the Adam Smith Institute and the Centre for Policy Studies, the tobacco industry. The IEA and the Adam Smith Institute have also received millions of dollars from US funders of climate denial. SNP MP Deidre Brock said that Truss lifting a number of her policies from the think tanks raises worrying questions about the functioning of our democracy, the impact of dark money on UK politics and the allegiances of Boris Johnsons potential successor. Liz Truss must immediately answer concerns about her close personal connections with these organisations and the lack of transparency around their donors, she said. The Labour MP Clive Lewis added: Truss being a puppet for dark money interests is, unfortunately, the rule of how British politics is done, and not an exception to it. The government has the power and tools needed to address the cost of living crisis  for example, through extending the windfall tax, nationalising utilities, funding a mass home retrofit, and establishing universal basic income and services. The only reason such a programme will not be delivered is because it will not favour the private interests who are benefiting from the cost of living crisis, such as the funders of dark money think tanks that appear to be driving the incoming Truss governments agenda. Charities campaigning for increases to Universal Credit in response to the cost of living crisis have condemned the IEA after it referred to them as a poverty lobby in July and dismissed benefits aimed at alleviating poverty as handouts. Neil Cowan, policy and campaigner manager at the Poverty Alliance, said that anyone opposing an anti-poverty campaign is the real poverty lobby. People in the UK believe in justice and compassion, he said. They believe everyone has a right to a dignified, secure life. Putting those values into practice is not difficult  business can pay people a real living wage, and social security can be strengthened to keep people out of the grip of poverty. Anyone opposed to those policies is opposed to freedom, dignity, compassion, and justice. Truss being a puppet for dark money interests is, unfortunately, the rule of how British politics is done The IEAs list of policy prescriptions to address the cost of living crisis, published in July, pushed for a windfall tax on the renewables industry and an end to the UKs target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. A serious approach would stop putting Net Zero targets at the heart of policy, preferring instead efforts to align market carbon prices internally and with our industrial peers, writes its chief operating officer and energy analyst Andy Mayer. The IEAs former deputy research director Richard Wellings was criticised last week after saying pensioners could burn wood, old books etc to stay warm. The think tank also called for removing or reducing regulatory requirements on nurseries, which include regular inspections by the education watchdog Ofsted. Helen Donohoe, policy manager at the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said the proposals were a reductive hash of already rejected ideas. The prospect of these proposals reaching anything like a serious discussion in government is eye-wateringly worrying, she said. For early years and childcare they represent a surrender of all that we have gained, for children and for parents, in the name of shoddily substantiated claims to cutting costs. Truss pledges to end the ban on fracking and reduce the size of the government have been lobbied for by the Adam Smith Institute, where her longest-serving special adviser previously worked. Meanwhile, her plan to create free ports and full-fat investment zones  where business rates and regulation are suspended altogether  echo the Centre For Policy Studies 2019 proposal to create opportunity zones. Her vow to scrap green levies from energy bills was also first called for by the think tank in May. Another advisor of Liz Truss previously worked for the CPS and she has regularly given speeches at the think tank, which was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher. Campaigners say if Truss goes ahead with all three of the think tanks tax plans it would mean less money to support families, less cash for the NHS and social care. This is a cost of living scandal. The last thing Liz Truss should do is cut taxes for the biggest most profitable companies while some people are choosing between heating and eating, said Tax Justices executive director, Robert Palmer. Liz Truss is widely expected to be the winner when the new Conservative leader and prime minister is announced today. openDemocracy approached the Truss campaign for comment but it had not responded at the time of publication."
16,"Saudi Aramco is set to acquire 20 percent stake in RIL oil refinery and chemical business at a value of $75 billion or over 5.3 lakh crore. The announcement was made by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani during the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries on August 12. The RIL Saudi Aramco deal would be one of Indias largest foreign direct investment deals to date. Under the deal, Saudi Aramco will buy 20 percent stake in a proposed special purpose vehicle (SPV) housing RILs twin refineries as well as its petrochemical complex. Saudi Aramco has also agreed to supply 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude oil to RILs twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat on a long-term basis. RIL operates two refineries in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which have a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. The Jamnagar Refinery is one of the worlds largest oil refining facility. It can process 1.4 million barrels per day (BPD) and plans to expand its capacity to 2 million BPD by 2030."
120,"Home prices rose 15.8% in July, down from a month earlier as higher mortgage rates put a brake on demand, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national monthly survey released Tuesday. The monthly rate reflects the slowdown in increases from earlier this year as mortgage rates have doubled. In June, prices rose at an 18.1% rate. The sharp rise in housing costs is a direct result of the Federal Reserves attack on inflation through increases in interest rates. Although U.S. housing prices remain substantially above their year-ago levels, July's report reflects a forceful deceleration, said Craig Lazzara, director at S&P DJI. The theme of strong but decelerating prices was reflected across all 20 cities. Tampa, Miami and Dallas posted the highest year-over-year increases in price, at 31.8%, 31.7% and 24.7%, respectively. Housing had been a standout of the pandemic recovery as people sought larger homes and relocated while mortgage rates were at historically low levels. But housing has also been a contributor to inflation that is running at more than an 8% annual rate. Todays S&P CoreLogic Case Shiller index highlights this past summers cooling in real estate activity, with buyers reeling from double-digit jumps in monthly mortgage payments in July as rates floated above 5%, George Ratiu, senior economist & manager of economic research for Realtor.com, wrote ahead of the report. The combination of still-tight inventory in most markets and buyers trying to lock in a fixed monthly payment before rates rose even higher ensured that prices continued advancing, Ratiu added. However, the upward momentum has lost steam and it is clear that the market peak is now firmly behind us. The slowdown in prices comes as existing home sales are down nearly 20% from last year and new home sales fell 12.6% in July, following a drop in May. Sales for August are being reported on Tuesday. The fundamental supply-demand imbalance is likely to keep house prices appreciating, but rising mortgage rates will slow appreciation to a much more sustainable pace, Mark Fleming, chief economist at title insurer First American, wrote early Tuesday. As this house appreciation slows, buyers who were sidelined in the super hot seller's market may jump back into the market, he added."
75,"Fuel prices have shot up significantly by about 10 percent even before the fortnight review of petroleum products on Sunday, October 30, 2022, by the Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs). This is coming despite a stable price of crude oil on the world market. Checks by Joy Business indicate some market leaders such as GOIL and TotalEnergies are selling petrol at ¢13.99 a liter while Petrosol and Engen, have increased prices for both petrol and diesel astronomically. While Petrosol is now selling petrol for ¢17.45 per liter, Engen is selling a liter of petrol for ¢17.54 . Fuel prices shoot up significantly by about 10% before next pricing window The two OMCs are also now selling a liter of diesel for ¢19. 89 pesewas and ¢19.44 pesewas respectively. Fuel prices shoot up significantly by about 10% before next pricing window Some Industry players have attributed the surge in prices to recent depreciation of the cedi against the U.S dollar. An industry analyst told Joy Business that the OMCs can no longer wait for the bi-weekly review of prices of petroleum products because the Bulk Oil Distribution Companies have been selling to them at the current market rate. Already, the Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU) has indicated its intention of increasing transport fares, effective Saturday, October 29, 2022 by 19%. The increasing fuel prices will push inflation up. This will subsequently influence interest rates and the cost of borrowing. Fuel prices went up between 7% and 12% on October 16, 2022 According to the Institute for Energy Security (IES), this was due to the increases in price of the products on the international market, and the significant decline in the value of the local currency against the American greenback or US dollar."
162,"The economic news for Britain continues to cause concern. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has just forecast that British economic growth will slow sharply to the weakest of any major economy next year. And while this was in a broader downgrade to the worlds growth prospects after Russias invasion of Ukraine, it does not bode well for Boris Johnsons government. The IMF cut its forecast for British gross domestic product growth this year to 3.7% from Januarys forecast of 4.7%, while for 2023 the growth rate was almost halved to 1.2% from 2.3%. Cuts like these will feel like the country is in a recession even if technically the economy is still growing. Consumption is projected to be weaker than expected as inflation erodes real disposable income, while tighter financial conditions are expected to cool investment, the IMF said. Only last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) cut its 2022 growth forecast to 3.8% and reduced its 2023 forecast to 1.8%. As well as being the weakest growth of any country in the Group of Seven (G7) next year, the OBR pointed out that the scale of the downgrade is also larger than for any other G7 economy. The IMF also forecasted that inflation in Britain would stay higher than in any big advanced economy, dropping to 5.3% in 2023 from 7.4% this year, compared with falls to 2.9% in the United States and 2.3% in the eurozone. Labour shortages have predominantly come from older workers who have dropped out of the world place since the pandemic the IMF added. The IMF also gave governments advice that they should offer support for households facing big price increases as the cost of living crisis bites, but that it should be focused on poorer households more than anything."
64,"He Lifeng, head of China's state planning agency, is likely to succeed the country's economic tsar Vice Premier Liu He in March, but may struggle to maintain his predecessor's policy clout. He, 67, a confidant of President Xi Jinping, was elevated to the ruling Communist Party's Politburo during its once-every-five-years congress this month. That paves the way for He's expected promotion as the 70-year-old Liu is due to step down in March. The top priority for He will be to help Li Qiang - another Xi ally, tipped to become the new Premier in March - to pull the world's second-largest economy out of its worst downturn in decades amid disruptive COVID-19 curbs and a prolonged property crisis. The departing Liu, Xi's top economic adviser and a childhood friend, holds an unusually powerful portfolio: it covers economic policy, the financial sector and trade ties with Washington, overshadowing the role of outgoing Premier Li Keqiang. Xi, who secured a precedent-breaking third term as president at the party conclave, may want to restore some of the premiership's previous power under the incoming Li Qiang. Some analysts say part of the expanded role that Liu built up during his time as economic tsar could be taken over by other top officials. ""If He Lifeng does indeed get the job, his portfolio will overlap with that of the new Premier, Li Qiang,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. ""It remains to be seen who will have more influence in practice."" Liu, who has been vice premier since 2018, is seen by China watchers as the brains behind earlier reforms, including those to reduce excess factory capacity and financial risks. The Harvard-trained economist was also Xi's point person on trade negotiations with Washington, thanks to his international experience and fluent English. He Lifeng, a home-groomed economist and bureaucrat with close Xi ties, had worked for 25 years in Fujian province before moving to the northern municipality of Tianjin in 2009. His track record suggests he is likely to favour a more statist approach to economic management, Evans-Pritchard said. Serving under Xi in Fujian in the 1980s, He attended Xi's wedding ceremony when he married his second wife, the popular singer Peng Liyuan, sources have said. In 2014, He was named vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission - the state planning agency - before taking full control in 2017. Since then He has joined Xi on domestic tours, diplomatic meetings and other engagements. The expected departure of pro-reform officials, including Liu, top banking regulator Guo Shuqing and central bank chief Yi Gang, has raised concerns over the quality of policymaking as officials become increasingly focused on displays of loyalty to Xi and less on governance and economic performance. ""The chance of making policy mistakes will be greater if officials only talk about politics and do not follow economic rules,"" a policy source said, speaking on condition of anonymity."

194,"Labours 1983 manifesto was dubbed the longest suicide note in history and the party was soundly trounced by Mrs Thatcher in that years general election. On Friday 23 September 2022, Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng delivered his first mini-budget, which, despite his best intentions, may deliver the same disservice to the Conservatives. On top of the energy price guarantee given to households by new prime minister Liz Truss costing about £60 billion over the next six months alone, the Chancellor splashed out another £60 billion to reduce energy bills for businesses plus £45 billion of corporate, payroll and income tax cuts, squarely focused on the wealthy. Altogether, these tax cuts and spending increases exceed those implemented during the pandemic, and they send government debt on an unsustainable trajectory. Chart 1. The great British productivity slowdown Note: ONS, Quarterly output per hour worked whole economy chained volume measure (CVM) index (2008 Q2= 100). The dashed line is predicted value after 2008Q2 assuming historical average rate of 2.1%. Table 32. (Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.) The rationale for this largesse is to stimulate growth. I concur with the Chancellor that this is our major problem. But tax cuts are just a quick-fix sugar-high  they do not deal with the UKs fundamental problem of miserable productivity growth. Since the global financial crisis of 2007-09, UK output per hour has grown five times more slowly than it did in the previous three decades (see Chart 1). The pain of slow productivity growth has been shared rather democratically: pay growth has stagnated for almost all wage earners including those at the top and in the middle. Running a larger government deficit is sound policy when demand is low, there is excess capacity and interest rates are near zero. This was the case when the Conservatives returned to power in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2010. Ironically, then Chancellor George Osborne embraced full-throated austerity and cut public investment at exactly the wrong time, damaging productivity. The same party is now launching a massive deficit expansion when interest rates are rising and inflation is in double digits. Liz Truss boasts of rejecting orthodox economics by favouring debt-financed tax cuts. But the policies of expansionary contractions (Osbornes austerity) and Brexits economic benefits (Johnsons raison detre) were also fringe economic views. Standard economic expertise on these big issues has been denigrated and ignored. The people in this country have had enough of experts said former minister Michael Gove  and the results have been prolonged stagnation. I support protecting households from the soaring gas prices caused by Putins invasion of Ukraine. But the right policy would be to offset this cost with solidarity levies from better-off households and windfall taxes on energy-producing firms. Instead, we have huge unfunded tax cuts. The governments answer is that these tax cuts will generate supply-side growth. Common sense and reams of economic studies show that this is simply not the case. Many high-tax economies like Germany and the Nordic nations are robustly successful and big tax cuts for top earners have no clear relationship with growth (although they definitely increase inequality). The current government seems entranced with US Republican ideas that have been mugged by reality. The idea that lowering tax rates will bring in more revenue is called the Laffer Curve after Arthur Laffer who was, well, having a laugh. It is possible that when top tax rates are extremely high (as the 90% plus rates immortalised by the Beatles), cuts can be self-financing. But no respectable economist believes this to be the case for current UK levels of taxation. There are many ways that we could get good productivity growth. The UK suffers from chronic underinvestment especially in innovation and skills. Radical reforms of planning, property tax and green industrial policy could boost real supply-side growth. Here are some of my ideas for a proper plan. By contrast, the new government has little detail on what its supply-side reforms will be. What we do know about their plans  such as the creation of more low tax, low regulation investment zones  are no game changers. The evidence shows that far from creating fresh investment, these will largely lead to geographical relocation of investment within the country at the expense of areas outside the zones. The chronic disease of successive UK governments is the policy attention deficit disorder that has created massive uncertainty, sapping economic growth. This was on full display in the mini-budget. In the face of a complete reversal of tax policy and a refusal to allow the independent Office for Budget Responsibility to analyse the implications of this fiscal event, it was left to the financial markets to provide judgement by driving sterling to a 37-year low. Although prime ministers come and go  four in the last six years alone  what is consistent is policy failure. From premature austerity to the disaster of Brexit and now a revisit of the ill-fated Barber Boom. To mix metaphors from Seamus Heaney and Karl Marx, history is rhyming, first as tragedy and now as farce. When the inevitable reckoning comes, will the UK be able to rebuild or is the damage now too permanent and too deep? I am an optimist and believe a new Marshall Plan for real growth is possible and can be delivered if we show the kind of will on display during the COVID crisis to innovate new vaccines. But we must realise that policies for good growth are a long slog, a marathon of difficult supply-side reforms and not this re-run of the mad dash for growth with a mini-budget."
169,"The FT reports that  Some of the worlds most respected oil traders have predicted crude prices could climb beyond $200 a barrel this year owing to a growing international boycott of Russia and a lack of alternative sources of supply. Pierre Andurand, one of the sectors best-known hedge fund managers, said supplies of Russian oil into Europe would disappear in the aftermath of Vladimir Putins invasion of Ukraine, leading to a lasting reshaping of global energy markets. Andurand went on to say  Wakey, wakey. We are not going back to normal business in a few months, he told the FT Commodities Global Summit in Lausanne. I think were losing the Russian supply on the European side forever. Crude could even hit $250 barrel this year, double current levels, he said. Oil prices jumped 5% to over $121 a barrel yesterday as disruptions to Russian and Kazakh crude exports via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline added to worries over tight global supplies. Matters got worse when the latest rise came as Brent crude prices lifted on the back of more supply uncertainty, particularly in light of attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia over the weekend. Yesterday, we saw chancellor Rishi Sunak make his spring statement that turned out to be a mini-budget. The so-called giveaway really saw the Treasury office set to rake in billions of pounds in extra oil and gas revenue as the conflict in Ukraine drives up energy prices even further. At $122 a barrel, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) now expects the taxman to receive £25billion from the North Sea fossil fuel industry over the six years to 2026-27. That is £13.6billion more than forecast in the Budget just six months ago, meaning the tax take will more than double. The one year 5p tax reduction at the pump for one year will cost the Treasury £2.5 billion."
35,"Technology stocks led a broad rally on Wall Street Friday, capping another strong week for the market, as investors welcomed solid profits from Apple and other companies. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% and posted its first back-to-back weekly gains since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9%. Smaller company stocks also gained ground, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 2.3%. Apple's latest quarterly results showed the iPhone maker made even fatter profits during the summer than expected. Its shares rose 7.6% and led a rally in technology stocks that had largely been beat up a day earlier. Intel jumped 10.7% after delivering much bigger profit than analysts forecasted even though it said it saw worsening economic conditions. Gilead Sciences soared 12.9%, and T-Mobile US gained 7.4% after they also topped Wall Street's profit expectations. Investors were also encouraged by a report on consumer spending that came a day after new data showing the economy grew modestly in the third quarter and inflation eased. ""You have an economy that almost refuses to keel over, an economy that at its core is resilient, but a the same time inflation is easing and that is what the Fed wants and that's obviously what the market wants, said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. That's helped fuel hopes on Wall Street for a pivot by the Federal Reserve, where the central bank dials down the big interest-rate hikes that have shaken the market. Such a move could boost the market, though many analysts say such hopes may be overdone. The central bank has been very clear about its plan to err on the side of going too far in order to tame inflation, which means the big gains on hopes of a pullback seem premature, said Liz Young, chief investment strategist at SoFi. This rally has now gotten a bit irrational and fragile at this level, Young said. The S&P 500 rose 93.76 points to 3,901.06. The Dow gained 828.52 points to 32,861.80. The Nasdaq rose 309.78 points to 11,102.45. The Russell 2000 gained 40.60 points to 1,846.92. Many big U.S. companies have been reporting stronger earnings than expected, though the bag remains decidedly mixed. Solid earnings on Friday helped to offset a 6.8% drop for Amazon, which offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for upcoming revenue. It was the latest Big Tech company to take a beating this week after reporting some discouraging trends. It's a sharp turnaround after the group dominated Wall Street for years with seemingly unstoppable growth. Earlier in the week, Meta Platforms lost nearly a quarter of its value after reporting a second straight quarter of revenue decline amid falling advertising sales and stiff competition from TikTok. Microsoft and Google's parent company also reported slowdowns in key areas. Such woes have created a sharp split on Wall Street this week, between lagging Big Tech stocks and the rest of the market. The Nasdaq, which is stuffed with high-growth tech stocks, notched a 2.2% gain this week. It would have had an even worse showing if not for Apple's boost from Friday. The Dow, meanwhile, jumped 5.7% for the week because it has less of an emphasis on tech. Rising interest rates have hit Big Tech stock prices harder than the rest of the market, and the pressure increased Friday as yields climbed. The markets still seem to not want to believe that we might end up in a place where an earnings recession is possible, Young said. Data released in the morning showed the raises that U.S. workers got in wages and other compensation during the summer was in line with economists expectations. That should keep the Fed on track to keep hiking rates sharply in hopes of weakening the job market enough to undercut the nations high inflation. Other data showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation remains very high, and U.S. households continue to spend more in the face of it. The Fed is trying to starve inflation of the purchases made by households and businesses needed to keep it high. It's doing that by intentionally slowing the economy and the jobs market. The worry is that it could go too far and cause a sharp downturn. The Fed has already raised its benchmark overnight interest rate up to a range of 3% to 3.25% up from virtually zero in March. The widespread expectation is for it to push through another increase that's triple the usual size next week, before it potentially makes a smaller increase in December. Higher rates not only slow the economy, they also hurt prices for stocks and other investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.42% from 4.28% late Thursday. The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and many other loans, climbed to 4.01% from 3.93%. Trading in Twitter's stock has ended, after Elon Musk took control of the company following a lengthy legal battle."
49,"Online social media platform Reddit became an unlikely stock trading hub in 2021. Groups of online traders in Reddit's WallStreetBets community orchestrated targeted buying campaigns in a handful of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market, triggering huge short squeezes and generating unprecedented volatility in a handful of so-called meme stocks. Robinhood Markets Inc. (ticker: HOOD) and other trading platforms were caught off guard by the meme stock mania and were forced to temporarily restrict buying of the most popular Reddit stocks, decisions that would prompt regulatory scrutiny and even a congressional hearing. At this point, excitement surrounding the most trendy Reddit stocks of 2021 has died down, and most meme stocks are now trading well off their highs. However, a few popular Reddit stocks have maintained their extreme volatility, and an online army of social media supporters says it isn't going away until the share prices of these stocks make it to the moon. Unfortunately, the underlying businesses of some of the most popular Reddit stocks are struggling, and their volatile share prices and high valuations makes them high-risk, speculative investments. But for investors who understand the risks and can handle a bumpy ride, here are the eight Reddit stocks generating the most buzz on WallStreetBets in 2022, according to social media tracking tool Swaggy Stocks: Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Apple Inc. (AAPL) GameStop Corp. (GME) Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Snap Inc. (SNAP) Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Electric vehicle maker Tesla and its controversial CEO Elon Musk are seemingly perpetually trending on social media. In recent months, the drama surrounding Musk and Tesla has had virtually nothing to do with Tesla's business. Musk made a $44 billion buyout offer for social media platform Twitter Inc. (TWTR) priced at $54.20 per share back in April. He then sold about $6.9 billion of his Tesla stock as part of his effort to fund the Twitter acquisition before attempting to back out of the deal, prompting Twitter to sue him to enforce it. The Twitter deal appears likely to close by Oct. 28, but Tesla shareholders are likely annoyed with the distraction, as a combination of Musk's selling, auto market supply chain disruptions and a broad market rotation out of growth stocks has Tesla trading down more than 40% this year. Tesla also recently missed consensus analyst estimates with its third-quarter auto deliveries and revenue. Even after the 2022 sell-off, Tesla's stock still trades at 38.7 times forward earnings estimates and 9 times sales, making it steeply valued compared with other auto and large-cap tech stocks. TSLA Price Today by TradingView Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Shares of popular video streaming platform Netflix took a huge hit in early 2022 after the company reported two consecutive quarters of negative subscriber growth. Netflix was once the unquestioned leader in streaming video content, but it has faced a tidal wave of new competition in recent years, led by Disney+ from Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Prime Video from Amazon. Fortunately, Netflix broke its pattern of subscriber losses in the third quarter, surprising Wall Street by adding 2.4 million net subscribers. That growth far exceeded its own guidance and analyst expectations of just 1 million subscriber additions. Netflix is also breaking away from its traditional business model and is debuting an ad-supported subscription tier priced at $6.99 per month in select markets starting in November. A more affordable subscription tier could certainly boost subscriber numbers, but it's unclear at this point whether or not the ad-supported tier will cannibalize subscribers from Netflix's higher-priced tiers. Netflix also plans to crack down on password sharing starting in 2023. Reddit traders appear to be optimistic about Netflix's new $6.99 tier, which will be $1 per month cheaper than similar ad-supported subscriptions offered by Hulu and Disney+. NFLX Price Today by TradingView Apple Inc. (AAPL) Reddit traders have a reputation for high-risk, high-volatility stocks, but WallStreetBets is about more than just memes and ""YOLO"" trades. Apple has been one of the best and most consistent blue-chip tech stocks of the past decade. You likely won't see GameStop in the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) portfolio any time soon, but Apple is by far the largest stock holding of legendary value investor Warren Buffett's holding company. Buffett is likely a big fan of Apple's profitability, its massive cash hoard and its transition to a more recurring and highly visible services revenue model. Apple reported 3% iPhone revenue growth and 12% services growth in the most recent quarter, but ""other products"" revenue dropped 8%. Many investors are concerned that rising interest rates will trigger a U.S. recession, but Apple's pristine balance sheet and highly profitable business make it a great defensive bet in an uncertain economic environment. Apple shares are down 15.9% this year as of Oct. 26, but it is still the best-performing stock on this list and has fared slightly better than the S&P 500 as a whole. Apple may not be the high-flying stock it once was, but it certainly has Reddit traders buzzing. AAPL Price Today by TradingView GameStop Corp. (GME) More than any other stock, GameStop embodies the 2021 WallStreetBets meme stock ethos. Reddit traders rallied around GameStop in early 2021, sending its stock price soaring from less than $20 to as high as $483 in a matter of weeks in one of the highest-profile short squeezes of all time. GameStop supporters had high hopes that Chewy Inc. (CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen could turn around the video game retailer's struggling business when he took a minority ownership stake in the company and then joined GameStop's board of directors in January 2021. So far, the turnaround effort hasn't produced the results investors had anticipated. GameStop's revenue peaked back in 2012 and was steadily drifting lower even before 2020 shutdowns hit. In the most recent quarter, GameStop reported another $108.7 million net loss, its ninth quarter of losses out of the last 10. The company still has an unclear long-term turnaround plan, but it recently launched a non-fungible token, or NFT, marketplace and announced a new partnership with cryptocurrency exchange FTX. GameStop shares are down 31.5% this year as of Oct. 26, but Reddit traders don't seem to care. They still like the stock. GME Price Today by TradingView Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms has faced one headwind after another in 2022. Meta changed its name from Facebook in November 2022 as part of a strategic shift in focus to building the metaverse, an integrated virtual online environment in which people live, work and play. In February 2022, Meta shares plummeted 26% after the company said Apple's privacy policy changes will decrease Meta's revenue by about $10 billion in 2022. Meta's market capitalization dropped by $230 billion that day, the largest single-day drop in value for one stock in the history of the U.S. stock market. Meta also reported its metaverse business lost $10 billion in 2021 and said its Facebook app lost about 1 million daily active users, its first year-over-year drop in users in the company's history. Things went from bad to worse in July, when Meta reported its first negative revenue growth since the company went public back in 2012. Meta shares are now down about 70% this year, and it may still be years before investors will know whether or not the company's metaverse investments will pay off. Reddit traders seem confident the company can find a way to stop the bleeding at some point. META Price Today by TradingView Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Shares of online retail and cloud services giant Amazon have slumped in 2022, putting investors in unfamiliar territory. Amazon reported just 7% revenue growth in the first two quarters of 2022, its slowest growth rate in more than two decades. In addition, the company reported an $11.5 billion loss on its ownership stake in electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) in the first half of 2022. Amazon also laid off nearly 100,000 employees during the second quarter as it deals with rising labor costs in an inflationary environment. Fortunately, Amazon has guided for third-quarter revenue growth of between 13% and 17%, suggesting the company may be gaining momentum heading into the end of the year. Amazon has been investing heavily in logistics and other services that position it well to accelerate its revenue growth once again in 2023 and beyond. Finally, Amazon's massive community of Prime members are helping to grow its advertising business, which reported impressive 18% revenue growth in the second quarter. Amazon's AWS cloud services business is also still firing on all cylinders, growing revenue by 33% in the quarter. Reddit traders still clearly see a lot to like about Amazon. AMZN Price Today by TradingView Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is exposed to some of the largest and fastest-growing tech fields, including PC gaming, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Despite supply chain disruptions, AMD reported impressive 70.1% revenue growth in the second quarter. Unfortunately, the geopolitical landscape hasn't been particularly kind to AMD in recent months. Analysts say AMD competitor Intel Corp. (INTC) may disproportionately benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocates more than $52 billion to domestic U.S. semiconductor production. AMD shares also took a hit in October, after the U.S. unveiled a new set of rules restricting the sale of advanced computing semiconductors to China to protect national security and foreign policy interests. AMD is expected to roll out its fourth-generation EPYC server processors in the fourth quarter of 2022, and Reddit investors seem to believe AMD will continue to gain market share from Intel for the foreseeable future. AMD shares have pulled back significantly so far in 2022, but the sell-off has made the stock more appealing from a value perspective. Shares now trade at 4.4 times sales and 15.3 times forward earnings, an extremely attractive valuation for a stock with a massive addressable market and such impressive growth numbers. AMD Price Today by TradingView Snap Inc. (SNAP) As bad as things have been for Meta in 2022, they have somehow been even worse for competing social media company and Snapchat parent Snap. In February 2021, Snap guided for 50% revenue growth over the next several years. Unfortunately, Snap's revenue growth slowed to just 6% in the third quarter of 2022. While Snap grew its daily active users by 19% in the quarter, its average revenue per user was down 11% from a year ago. Snap's advertising business also took a big hit from Apple's privacy changes, but its biggest problem may be TikTok. For years, Snapchat was known for its appeal to the youngest generation of social media users, but TikTok has now taken over as the most-popular social media app among teenage users, according to Piper Sandler. While Facebook's growth has slowed significantly, Meta still reported a $6.7 billion profit last quarter. In the third quarter, Snap reported a $360 million net loss. Given the company's struggles, it's understandable why the stock is down as 79.6% of Oct. 26, making it the worst performer on this list. Reddit traders haven't lost faith in Snap and are betting on a turnaround at some point."
102,"The Federal Reserves favored measure of inflation remained unchanged in September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Friday. However, the core index, leaving out often volatile food and energy costs, rose to a 5.1% annual rate from Augusts 4.9% level. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell often points to the core PCE as a barometer of inflation when discussing monetary policy. Personal spending rose 0.6% in September, showing consumers still have some firepower left. Rate hikes? What rate hikes? Personal Income & Outlays show Americans increase spending and made more money in September at a pace above estimates, Navy Federal Credit Union Corporate Economist Robert Frick tweeted. The report is the last government reading on inflation before the Fed meets on Tuesday to consider monetary policy. Most analysts expect that two-day meeting will conclude with the central bank raising rates by 75 basis points as it continues its campaign against inflation. On Thursday, the government reported that gross domestic product increased by 2.6% annually in the third quarter, though there were signs of a slowdown. The housing sector has been hit by high mortgage rates and there are weaknesses in retail and the tech industry. Amazon on Thursday forecast weak fourth quarter sales, suggesting the upcoming holiday season would not be as robust as some retailers had hoped. The key to our outlook is what path inflation will take, says Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial. If the Fed raises rates and slows down the economy, then inflation will come down. The question, though, is at what cost. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the regime of higher interest rates will bring pain to business and consumers alike, and that could take the form of increased unemployment and a recession. Already, Powell is feeling political heat from Democrats worried about the effect on higher interest rates as they also try to deflect blame for inflation that is running at an 8.2% annual rate. Raising rates now when prices may come down would be foolish and damaging to American consumers and small businesses, Colorado Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper wrote in a letter to Powell Thursday, adding that the Feds actions so far have failed to knock inflation down. There have been meaningful declines in prices in some areas of the economy. Housing prices are now rising at a 13% annual rate compared to 20% at their peak earlier this year. Gasoline prices have fallen more than $1 a gallon from their $5 peak this summer. But what concerns economists and the Fed is that inflation has spread from the goods sector to the services part of the economy and the labor market remains tight, putting pressure on employers to increase wages. Dan Wantrobski, technical director at Janney Montgomery Scott, says that the economy has largely shed the main effects of the coronavirus, with supply chain disruptions easing and businesses operating closer to normal. The U.S. economy is running hot, he says. I think it is going to continue hot. Beyond the amount that the Fed hikes rates next week, observers will be looking for what Powell says in his press conference about the economy and future monetary policy. Markets are hoping for signs the Fed could be poised for a halt, or reduction, in the amount of interest rate increases as it assesses what effect its aggressive tightening has had on the economy."
109,"The number of job openings fell by more than 1 million to just over 10 million in August, signaling that employers are preparing for leaner times, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday. The 10.1 million openings compares to 11.3 million in July but is still a high number historically. However, while hiring remains stable the lower number of potential hires suggests companies are paring back on their future employment plans. The largest decreases came in health care and social assistance, down 236,000; other services, dropping by 183,000 and retail, falling by 143,000. The monthly report is one of many out this week on the health of the labor market, culminating in the monthly jobs number released on Friday. Economists expect that number to come in around 250,000, although it has surprised to the upside in recent months. Private payroll firm ADP will also release its monthly jobs survey on Wednesday. While other parts of the economy have begun to show the effects of higher interest rates, notably housing where home sales are off by nearly 25% from a year ago, the job market has remained resilient so far. This comes even as many economists predict the U.S. economy is headed for a recession sometime in the next year. To determine the risk of a downturn, Wells Fargo economic researchers looked at the historical differences in yields for short and long duration bonds to determine whether an inverted yield curve, where investors are getting more yield for shorter term bonds than longer ones, is a reliable indicator of a looming recession. Normally, investors are paid more for taking on longer-term debt, as that is presumed to be riskier given the unpredictability of the economy over time. When the opposite happens, it means investors are more doubtful of the economys short-term prospects. The bank looked at many different bond yields, but focused on the relationship between the 10-year and 1-year Treasuries. Recently, our preferred 10-year/1-year yield spread breached the recession-prediction threshold in August and remained negative through September, suggesting there is a 91% chance of a recession during the next 12 months, it concluded. Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America, says that Fridays jobs number could well be a good one, but there are still signs the labor market may be weakening. So although we may continue to see some strong job gains for a few months to come, the party will be over soon, North says in an email. Thats because the Fed has jacked up rates so far so fast, and is going to continue doing so, that it will send the economy into recession by the end of this year or early next year. And Monster, the online job search site, is noticing a pickup in searches for part-time work, often an indicator that workers may be looking for extra work to make ends meet. Were seeing workers who already have jobs are needing to seek additional income, beyond their base salary to manage the economic impact, says Monster Economist Giacomo Santangelo in an email. This may mean taking on more work at their current job, working a second job, or seeking part-time or gig work to help meet financial obligations. We expect this trend to endure as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, driving up unemployment and leaving many workers in need of other sources of income, he added."
195,"After Kwasi Kwartengs so-called fiscal event or mini-budget as other commentators preferred to call it  Kwarteng decided to use his PhD in economic history and double down on the massive tax-cutting exercise he announced just days earlier  by announcing at the weekend that even more cuts were coming. By 7 am Monday morning, the markets decided he was wrong and that Trussonomics was going to fail. As I predicted last Friday  Sterling would crash and it has. The Singapore-on-Thames project is sinking before it gets off the ground. As the FT reported at 0700 hrs  Sterling slid as much as 4.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.035, hitting a record low in Asian trading on Monday after UK chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng vowed to pursue more tax cuts. Lets not forget that this is an all-time record. It was 1985 when the last low was recorded at this level. Back then, at $1.070 the US Dollar strengthened as the tail-end of the oil crisis came about forcing down the value of Sterling. Twice in the next two decades, GBP recovered to break through the $2.00 barrier, but the dotcom crash and financial crisis both inflicted falls to just below $1.50. Then came Brexit. Within a year, Sterling was trading at $1.20 and by April this year, traders and investors were rapidly losing confidence in the UK as both political and economic instability became the norm. Brexit couldnt be solved. Three Prime Ministers can attest to that. The fourth in six years in now in the crosshairs of reality. With Boris Johnson and his cabinet being evicted from office by his own party for their incompetence and his unacceptable behaviour, Truss ascended to the highest office in the land. As I said  her actions are a last desperate roll of the dice. Things are so bad  Truss cannot go to the electorate to seek a mandate from the public. The big problem with her ultra free market ideology is that even if it could work  it would take a lot longer than the two years she has available to her. In other words  there is no economic miracle on the way, and the markets know it. Brexit has proven one thing though. In todays world, having friends and not being isolated is far more important than attempting to be something you are not. The worlds greatest economy  America, is being tested by a challenger  China. And China knows it needs friends and allies  hence the One Belt initiative. The Middle East has dramatically changed its allegiances in the last few years. Africa is on the rise, India has just overtaken the UK in GDP rankings. Populists are creating havoc everywhere. Britain is no longer a member of the EU and as weve all just found out (again)  the US/UK special relationship means nothing. Britain has no global leading-edge technology and no manufacturing ability. It is reliant on trading partners. The United Kingdom is facing real danger. First, the world economy and the order of it is changing very quickly as it adapts to the effects of the pandemic and Russias attack on Ukraine. Global supply chains and changes to the workforce (long Covid/early retirement/working from home/EU workers) along with severe inflationary pressures mean any country has to be politically and economically fit for the challenges ahead. Brexit has destabilised everything. But more to the point, the Tory party has made a string of disastrous decisions that has led directly to this point. So, what next? From here, its more of the same. More instability, more turmoil, more shouting, finger-pointing and divisiveness. The economy will not get the kick-start that Trussonomics promises. The winter will be a proving ground for the economic policies of nearly thirteen years of the Tory reign  and the result wont be pretty."

The WFE is a non-profit organisation, which has the objective to contribute to the development, support, and promotion of organised and regulated securities and derivatives markets, to meet the needs of the worlds capital markets in the best interests of their users. As a full member of the Federation, the GSE will benefit from the WFEs work done by its various Working Committees as well as from the interaction with other members to further develop the stock market in Ghana to increase its relevance and contribution to the Ghanaian financial sector eco-system and the economy at large. Membership in the association will also boost investor confidence in the Ghanaian market as we support the Government to make Ghana a gateway to Africa and a global Financial Hub. In his remarks, the Managing Director of the Ghana Stock Exchange, Ekow Afedzie said: This is another milestone chalked by the Exchange and becoming a full member of the WFE is a testament to our commitment to adhering to the highest international standards and best practices to move this Exchange from a frontier to an emerging market status. GSE looks forward to taking advantage of every opportunity available to members to develop the market"
52,"He Lifeng, head of China's state planning agency, is likely to succeed the country's economic tsar Vice Premier Liu He in March, but may struggle to maintain his predecessor's policy clout. He, 67, a confidant of President Xi Jinping, was elevated to the ruling Communist Party's Politburo during its once-every-five-years congress this month. That paves the way for He's expected promotion as the 70-year-old Liu is due to step down in March. The top priority for He will be to help Li Qiang - another Xi ally, tipped to become the new Premier in March - to pull the world's second-largest economy out of its worst downturn in decades amid disruptive COVID-19 curbs and a prolonged property crisis. The departing Liu, Xi's top economic adviser and a childhood friend, holds an unusually powerful portfolio: it covers economic policy, the financial sector and trade ties with Washington, overshadowing the role of outgoing Premier Li Keqiang. Xi, who secured a precedent-breaking third term as president at the party conclave, may want to restore some of the premiership's previous power under the incoming Li Qiang. Some analysts say part of the expanded role that Liu built up during his time as economic tsar could be taken over by other top officials. ""If He Lifeng does indeed get the job, his portfolio will overlap with that of the new Premier, Li Qiang,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. ""It remains to be seen who will have more influence in practice."" Liu, who has been vice premier since 2018, is seen by China watchers as the brains behind earlier reforms, including those to reduce excess factory capacity and financial risks. The Harvard-trained economist was also Xi's point person on trade negotiations with Washington, thanks to his international experience and fluent English. He Lifeng, a home-groomed economist and bureaucrat with close Xi ties, had worked for 25 years in Fujian province before moving to the northern municipality of Tianjin in 2009. His track record suggests he is likely to favour a more statist approach to economic management, Evans-Pritchard said. Serving under Xi in Fujian in the 1980s, He attended Xi's wedding ceremony when he married his second wife, the popular singer Peng Liyuan, sources have said. In 2014, He was named vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission - the state planning agency - before taking full control in 2017. Since then He has joined Xi on domestic tours, diplomatic meetings and other engagements. The expected departure of pro-reform officials, including Liu, top banking regulator Guo Shuqing and central bank chief Yi Gang, has raised concerns over the quality of policymaking as officials become increasingly focused on displays of loyalty to Xi and less on governance and economic performance. ""The chance of making policy mistakes will be greater if officials only talk about politics and do not follow economic rules,"" a policy source said, speaking on condition of anonymity."
150,"Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine has finally forced the UK government to get serious about the countrys dirty money problem. But does the Economic Crime Bill have the capability to tackle Britains huge dirty money operations? The welcome mat that successive UK governments put out in Londongrad for Russian oligarchs and firms with close links to the Putin regime, now looks at best extraordinarily naïve and at worst willfully negligent. This is especially true when you consider the strong warnings from bodies such as the Intelligence and Security Committee and defence experts. The new Economic Crime Act  which was rushed through Parliament at break-neck speed in March, to make foreign ownership of property more transparent and make it easier for the UK to impose sanctions  was widely seen as a long-overdue shutting of stable doors At the time, the government acknowledged that there was more work to do, and more gaps to be closed. So will the new Economic Crime Bill announced in the Queens speech fill those gaps? Will it finally solve the UKs economic crime problem, whether it be dirty money laundered by kleptocrats and mafia organisations or the vast fraud epidemic? A part of the UK government machinery has been at the heart of an endless stream of global and domestic economic crime scandals over the past decade Central to the new bill is reform to Companies House  a small part of the UK government machinery, whose failure to police companies set up in Britain has been at the heart of an endless stream of global and domestic economic crime scandals over the past decade. According to analysis by Spotlight on Corruption, the UK government spends £852m a year fighting economic crime  the equivalent of just 0.04% of GDP. Thats despite economic crime costing the UK economy at least £290bn a year  equal to 14.5% of GDP. From bounce-back COVID loans fraud, set to cost the taxpayer up to £4.9bn, to the Russian laundromat that saw Russias security services and Putins family use UK companies to syphon billions out of Moscow, fraudsters and criminals exploit the lack of checks on who runs UK companies to launder money and evade detection. In 2020, the USs financial intelligence unit, FINCEN, classified the UK as a higher risk jurisdiction because of the number of UK-registered companies repeatedly cropping up in suspicious activity reports. Reforming the agency, to allow it to check who is behind companies and correct inaccurate data, has been in the wings for more than four years. Earlier this year, openDemocracy reported on a litany of fake names used by fraudsters and pranksters, with apparently no attempt to stop them. In April, openDemocracy revealed that UK government officials have had their identities stolen by fraudsters to create bogus companies. With that in mind, the real test of the legislation will be whether new powers allow for proactive prevention of economic crime (not just identifying it after its happened). That will necessitate robust and comprehensive screening to weed out dodgy companies. It will also require sufficient resourcing for the agency to implement its new powers. The current price of £12 to set up a company in the UK is ludicrously low (in the US it costs the equivalent of £400 to do so and in Australia £200). There is widespread agreement across the private sector, civil society and Parliament that this should be significantly raised to help fund Companies Houses powers to police the register. Other than this reform  which is probably the most important economic crime reform of the decade and is crucial to get right  the bill also covers new powers to police crypto-assets and allow banks to share intelligence about bad guys. Law enforcement will now be able to seize crypto-assets where they are linked to criminality. Concerningly, however, the Queens speech also included a new Financial Services and Markets Bill, to cut red tape in the financial sector to make the UK an even more attractive place to invest and do business, while making sure that high standards are maintained. A rapid adoption of crypto and deregulation carry massive dirty money risks Specifically, the bill envisages rolling out the safe adoption of cryptocurrencies in the UK and resilient outsourcing to technology companies. This, plus the Brexit Freedoms Bill also included in the speech, suggests that a major deregulatory drive is on the agenda. Both a rapid adoption of crypto and deregulation carry massive dirty money risks. Last year saw cybercriminals laundering $8.6bn worth of crypto, a 30% rise on 2020 levels, and there have been reports that Russian oligarchs have been using crypto assets to evade sanctions. Proposals touted in The Daily Telegraph, for the UK to allow marketing of crypto assets and legal challenges to regulators, carry high risks. It is essential that the UKs financial integrity is not sacrificed on the altar of financial innovation. Meanwhile, major deregulation also carries significant dirty money threats. In its 2020 Russia Report, the Intelligence and Security Committee noted that the promotion of a light and limited touch to regulation was a major factor in attracting Putin-linked oligarchs to London. As Labour MP Margaret Hodge has argued, it is hard to see how deregulation and maintaining high standards can be reconciled. The much-vaunted Brexit dividend, through financial deregulation, may throw open new doors to dirty money To address these dangers, it is essential that new deregulatory measures face an economic crime impact assessment before being introduced. The government also needs to come forward with an ambitious new Economic Crime Plan  MPs in the banking all-party parliamentary group are tomorrow launching a manifesto of ideas on which it can draw. Within this plan, the government must prioritise three key measures. Firstly, it must massively increase resourcing for law enforcement. Secondly, it must get a grip on the crazy panoply of money-laundering supervisors and the fact that legal and accountancy sectors largely self-regulate when it comes to dirty money. And finally, it must make it possible to prosecute large companies and banks for financial skulduggery, which, shockingly, is still not an option in 21st-century Britain. Storm clouds are gathering over the economy and the government is resetting to attract voters. Nows the time to make sure the rush to cash in on the much-vaunted Brexit dividend, through financial deregulation, does not throw open new doors to dirty money just as the old ones begin to close."
182,"There are few commentators that either agrees or commends Rishi Sunaks Spring Statement as worthy of the impending cost of living crisis heading towards one-quarter of all households in Britain. Student fee loans are going to take the brunt as the cost of servicing them will soon be doubled. Indeed, there was much to say about just how cynical this entire statement was. The 5p tax taken off the pump price of diesel and petrol not only meant very little in real terms  but the average cut actually made by retailers was 2.7p  as they took the opportunity to pocket the rest by increasing prices  when the market price of fuel had not actually increased in the first place. Worse, in background documentation of Sunaks statement  it looks rather more like he will increase the same tax by 8p per litre next year. There were other tax manoeuvres that were interpreted as nothing more than political chicanery, but quite possibly the most cynical in all of this was to make university students pay for much of Sunaks giveaways. The cost of the chancellors spring statement is going to be paid primarily by one group of people: future students. The Times reports that  changes to how graduates pay back their student loans will make the Treasury £35.2 billion over the next six years. A graduate who pays £47,000 in repayments today would pay around £100,000 under the new system. This is more than a 100 per cent increase in debt repayment by future students. At the moment, students start repaying their debt once they earn £27,295, at a rate of 9 per cent of anything they earn above this threshold, and the debt is wiped after 30 years. But from next year, they will start repaying once they earn £25,000 and it will last 40 years  in other words, almost their whole working lives. Around 66 per cent of graduates (about 1.5 million) currently take out student fee loans, UK student debt statistics confirm. When we turn the percentage into real numbers, the student loan number reaches a whopping £20 billion each year. The value of outstanding loans at the end of March 2021 reached £141 billion. The Government forecasts the value of outstanding loans to be around £560 billion (2019?20 prices) by the middle of this century. The average debt among the cohort of borrowers who finished their courses in 2020 was just over £46,000."
80,"The weak performance of the Ghana cedi to the dollar impacted negatively on the Ghana Stock Exchange, as the Accra Bourse was the worst performing stock exchange on the African continent in dollar term, in the nine months of 2022. It recorded -39% return for investors in dollar term as of September 30, 2022. However, in cedi term, it registered -11.80% return for investors. This performance is far from last years achievement where it was the second best performing stock market in Africa. In dollar term, the GSE placed 15th out of 15 top stock exchanges in Africa. In cedi term, its position was 11th. The capital market has so far this year not been left out of the challenging economic environment. It was hit severely by the rapid depreciation of the cedi and the rising inflation in the first-half of this year, and the situation continues unabated. For the Financial Stock Index, the market has recorded -3.80% for investors, so far in 2022. Also, total market capitalization at the end of September 2022 stood at ¢63.9 billion, compared with ¢64.49 billion in December 31, 2022. Meanwhile, 15 stocks had lost value since January 1, 2022, compared with seven gainers. SIC Insurance is the biggest gainer, recording a 312% gain in value since January 2022. It is presently selling at 33 pesewas per share. Access Bank follows closely, registering 27.30% gain in value, selling at ¢4.10 per share. Meanwhile, licensed buying cocoa firm, PBC, was the biggest loser shedding 33% in value. It is selling at 2 pesewas per share. GSE records -24.1% return in dollar term for investors in first-half of 2022 The GSE ended the first-half of of 2022 with a negative year-to-date return of 24.13% in dollar term.

13,"Elon Musk officially took over Twitter Thursday and immediately started making changes. The first order of business: ousting CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal. The moves marked an end to the tech industry's nightmare week, which saw giants from Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) to Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) take a wrecking ball to the teeth as each firm, one after another, reported slowing sales. Apple (AAPL) was the sole semi-winner, as its wearables and Mac businesses saved it from completely bumming out investors. The week kicked off Tuesday with Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft releasing quarterly results that showed slowing growth in key business segments. Alphabet's earnings were objectively tougher to look at with the company missing Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line. But the biggest headlines included a $400 million miss on YouTube ad revenue, a slowdown in Google Cloud Platform revenue, and net income that came up $5 billion short of last year's numbers. Shares of the search giant were down 6% on the week. Microsoft, which also reported earnings on Tuesday, fared better than Google in the prior quarter. The company beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, but its Intelligent Cloud segment growth fell year-over-year from 31% to 20%. It's all-important Azure cloud platform growth, meanwhile, fell from 50% to 35%. The company is still, in some watchers' eyes, set up to win long-term. [Microsoft] is one of the strongest companies on the planet,"" Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald told Yahoo Finance Live this week. Its one of the most widely held companies on the planet... Do you really want to get off a winning horse in the middle of the race? Thats what investors need to think. Nevertheless, this week, Microsoft just didn't look all that great to investors, and it was the company's outlook for Azure that seemed to sting the worst, with the tech giant predicting that its Azure business growth will decline another 5% in the current quarter. Microsoft shares were off 3% for the week as of mid-day Friday. Fellow cloud computing behemoth Amazon didn't fare much better, reporting misses on revenue and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales. Those AWS sales are vital to the company and even the slight miss  $20.5 billion actual versus $21 billion expected  was a disappointment. However, the real drag on Amazon was its Q4 guidance. In anticipation of a muted holiday season, the company guided to between $140 billion and $144 billion instead of the expected $155 billion. Amazon's results were ""really macro-related  inflation, interest rates, energy costs, the Ukraine war are impacting the consumer,"" Cowen Managing Director John Blackledge told Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""They're also dealing with lingering spend issues, but they're working on it."" Amazon's shares are down about 15% as of mid-day Friday. In a rough time, Meta stands out as perhaps the week's biggest loser. The Facebook parent reported on Wednesday that its revenue declined in Q3 and missed analysts' expectations, as the company's pivot towards the metaverse increasingly generates criticism and scrutiny from watchers. Meta's stock went into free fall on Thursday, and its shares are still down 21% for the week as of mid-day Friday. The one seeming bright spot for Big Tech this week came when Apple reported its Q4 earnings Thursday. While the company missed on revenue expectations for its iPhone and Services segments, it still managed to report record revenue for the quarter. But even Apple faltered. The company admitted that it will be stung by foreign exchange headwinds and that its Q4 growth will be lower than the 8% year-over-year growth it saw in Q3. Apple didn't provide exact guidance for its holiday quarter, but a drop during what is traditionally its best sales season could be damaging to the iPhone maker. So, Twitter might have been thrown a life raft with an anchor attached, but when looking at the rest of tech, it hasn't had the worst week. It's all relative in a bear market."
121,"Pending home sales fell for the fourth straight month in September, as mortgage rates topped 7% and the cost of buying a house soared, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. The groups pending home sales index tumbled 10.2% from August, leaving sales 31% below where they were a year ago. The number was worse than expected. ""Persistent inflation has proven quite harmful to the housing market,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. ""The Federal Reserve has had to drastically raise interest rates to quell inflation, which has resulted in far fewer buyers and even fewer sellers."" It is further evidence, along with a slowdown in new residential construction, that the heady days of the housing sector seen in 2021 and early 2022 are over. For buyers of a median-priced home who use a 20% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment has shot up a shocking $1,000 higher than last year, George Ratiu, senior economist and manager of economic research at Realtor.com said. With wages falling behind on account of inflation, and rates rising, buyers purchasing power has been reduced by over $100,000. There is also an effect on existing homeowners, who may be looking to sell as prices come off their highs of earlier this year. The number of new listings on the market is also down considerably, as existing homeowners sit tight with sub-3% mortgage rates, said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. The combination of sagging demand and limited inventory means that home sales activity will continue to drop off during the last quarter of the year. Overall, total home sales for 2022 will be down significantly from last year, likely hitting a level not seen since 2014. The rise in rates and drop in sales activity is a direct result of the Federal Reserves tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. The Fed is seeking to cool down the economy even if that results in higher unemployment and even a recession. The economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the third quarter, reversing direction after two previous quarters showed a contraction in the nations gross domestic output. Earlier Thursday, the governments personal consumption expenditures price index showed that spending increased 0.6% in September as Americans dipped into their savings and credit cards to continue consuming even as inflation held steady during the month. ""Todays report showed some positive signs: the topline PCE inflation number slowed, and incomes and consumer spending came in slightly above expectations, said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at data analytics firm Morning Consult. However, there are still reasons to worry. Core PCE inflation continued to rise, confirming consumers are still contending with elevated prices. Morning Consults proprietary monthly inflation data from mid-October hints that inflation may be slowing, but consumer spending will likely remain under pressure until meaningful price relief kicks in, Bruun added. Also Friday, the University of Michigans consumer sentiment survey for October remained largely unchanged and reflected a mixed bag of improving supply chain issues and worries over inflation and uncertainty over the economys future course. This month, buying conditions for durables surged 23% on the basis of easing prices and supply constraints, said Joanne Hsu, survey director. However, year-ahead expected business conditions worsened 19%. These divergent patterns reflect substantial uncertainty over inflation, policy responses, and developments worldwide, and consumer views are consistent with a recession ahead in the economy."
83,"The Bank of Ghana has assured it will not allow the black market to drive the exchange rate market in the country. According to the Governor, Dr. Ernest Addison, it will do everything possible within its remit to ensure that black market dealers do not dictate to the market. He added that his outfit has also created a Twitter page, purposely to give updates on the daily exchange rate. I think we should try to understand what is going on in the foreign exchange market. We have decided to introduce a Twitter page with the daily exchange rate that will be released every morning by the Bank of Ghana. Because we do not want the black market to be driving exchange rates in this country. And, we are hoping that this alone will help clear a lot of noise on the exchange forum. There have been all kinds of rumours about some conversions and foreign exchange balances into cedis. Definitely, nobody has even thought of any such measure, so we need to deal with such rumours with contempt because we are not looking at that sort of intervention at all. The Governor further said that as we are all aware, we got the $750 million from the AfriExim Bank and I think today [October 26, 2022], we are supposed to receive the $790 million from the COCOBOD syndicated loan so the Central Bank has some liquidity. Enough liquidity available till IMF programme takes off He also stressed that the Central Bank has enough liquidity to keep things relatively stable till the International Monetary Fund Programme kicks in and the financing assurances expected from other partners come in. I am aware of the recent developments in terms of liquidity in the banking sector. As I said, I took note of the advice from Washington on the financial stability issue that there has to be targeted liquidity support to preserve financial stability without undermining the inflation control objectives. So this is really the context we should have the discussion on all the complaints of we need liquidity and BoG not supplying liquidity. Yesterday I met the CEOs and I have assured them that we will provide the necessary liquidity to ensure that we dont have a system of a liquidity problem. But we do that within the context of keeping inflation low."
147,"We have all heard about the ever-increasing and widespread use of foodbank across the UK. Take, for instance, the Trussell Trust. It has seen a staggering increase in the number of food parcels distributed over the last five years. They provided more than 2.1 million emergency food parcels between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2022. Of these, 832,000 were for children. This represents an 81% increase compared to the same period five years ago. The Trussell Trust supports a nationwide network of more than 1,300 food bank centres. But now shoppers, those not using foodbanks are struggling too. Iceland boss, Richard Walker, claimed customers feeling the pinch of inflation are telling Iceland checkout staff to stop when they hit £40 before putting the rest of their shop back on the shelves. The cost of living crisis has seen the prices of everyday essentials soar, with the price of a loaf of bread increasing from 89p to £1.10 and milk prices increasing quite dramatically. The news comes as Rishi Sunak announced his cost of living support package. Walker commended the package saying Sunak had stepped up and pulled all the right levers despite one North East foodbank saying that the Chancellors support package was not enough. Everyones feeling the pinch but certainly the harder-pressed communities are feeling it more, Icelands managing director Richard Walker said to Sky News Generally, I think it is safe to say everyone is feeling the pinch now, it doesnt matter who you are. We do serve some of the poorer demographics around the country. We are hearing stories of some of our customs disappearing to food banks. The reality is there is no typical Iceland shopper, averages dont work very well because we have people who come in and spend five quid and people who come in and spend £50. The news comes after Asda chairman, Lord Stuart Rose, said the governments £15 billion cost of living handout is not enough to help struggling familiar and is only a drop in the ocean compared with the pressures consumers are facing. Rose claimed Asda was spending £90 million attempting to keep prices low for its shoppers."
165,"As robust as the economy has been throughout many events over the decades, there are indicators that the seas could get quite rough. The economy had only just recovered from its decade long erosion of living standards via the bank-led financial crisis when Brexit arrived and just as the uncertainty of that was calming, the pandemic arrived. Then Putins attack on Ukraine sucked all the headlines just as global inflationary pressures were being felt  which has since escalated. So why is credit card debt a signal of rough seas? Yesterday, it was reported by the Bank of England that UK consumers had borrowed a record amount in February, with many economists commenting it was a sign of the cost of living crisis was actually hitting wallets even before Putins invasion of Ukraine pushed energy prices higher. Theres only one day to go before average energy prices zoom up by 54 per cent. According to the BoE, individuals took on a net £1.5bn on credit cards in February. This was the highest monthly amount since records began in 1993. To put that into perspective  that figure is more than 300 per cent higher than the average of £400mn borrowed in the previous six months. Total consumer credit, which includes personal loans and car dealership finance, now stands at £1.9bn net  the highest level in five years. And this is at the time when those households that are able to weather the financial storms ahead have more cash saved for several decades. The FT reports that  Consumer borrowing is usually considered a measure of spending growth, but with inflation at a 30-year high and falling consumer confidence, some economists have warned that it was increasingly a sign of consumers running into debt to maintain their standard of living. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said; Weak sentiment also indicates that the big rise in consumer borrowing in February likely reflects households attempting to maintain their consumption at a time when real disposable income is falling sharply, rather than them going on a spending spree. Tombs went on to say that the data suggest that the economic recovery is about to shift down a gear. UK economic growth finally reaches pre-pandemic activity UK economic growth finally reaches pre-pandemic activity The FT quotes a number of experts who concur. The latest money and credit figures suggest that consumers are increasingly borrowing more to protect their lifestyles from the surge in inflation, echoed Thomas Pugh, UK economist at the accountancy firm RSM UK. However, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said it was more likely that the rise reflected households having the confidence to borrow and spend a bit more. The Office for National Statistics bi-weekly survey showed last week that 12 per cent of respondents were using credit cards more than usual to cope with increased prices in the first half of March. The proportion rose to 18 per cent for those aged 30 to 49 and to 21 per cent among renters. The same survey also showed that 10 per cent of people were now borrowing more from family and friends. As reported by The Economic Times yesterday, the BoE governor Andrew Bailey said this week that the UK was facing a historic hit to real incomes this year, as the cost of living crisis spirals. Data by the BoE also showed that consumers are now depositing less money in bank accounts than before the pandemic. Households deposited £4bn in banks and building societies, less than the £6.3bn average in the previous six months and down from the monthly average of £4.6bn in 2019."
134,"Imagine that a hostile power managed to infiltrate the UKs government. Imagine that it set out to demoralise and debilitate this country, destroying our sense of common purpose, undermining our stability and trashing the lives of many of our citizens. Imagine that it had to operate below the radar, within the structures of a nominally democratic system. Lets follow this thought experiment for a moment. What would such a hostile force set out to do? It would seek, first of all, to destroy trust. The people it planted in the government would lie prolifically, then lie about the lies, until we were so disoriented we no longer knew what to believe. They would damage our sense of national cohesion with a blatant disregard for the rules the rest of us must follow. They would seek to ensure that we lost faith in the political system and ceased to believe that those who govern us have our best interests at heart. The hostile power would also set out to destroy, through subtle and insidious cuts, our social infrastructure: the effective delivery of health, education, social, environmental and local services. It would allow our physical infrastructure  public transport, sewerage, public buildings and other essential services  to deteriorate until, in some cases, it came close to collapse. It would attack and undermine crucial symbols of national pride, such as the NHS, the BBC, the National Trust and the universities. It would further harm our sense of nationhood by trashing much of what we treasure and love, such as clean rivers, the green belt and well-planned cities. It would sow division by promoting inequality, enabling a prosperous elite to accumulate ever more of the countrys wealth. After all, as George Orwell remarked during the second world war, the lady in the Rolls-Royce car is more damaging to morale than a fleet of Goerings bombing planes. It would impede trading relations with our neighbours and major economic partners, in the hope of cutting us off from the world. It would undermine peace agreements and impose internal borders. It would allow crime to run rampant, permitting an explosion of devastating fraud and financial crimes such as money laundering that further harm our international standing and the concept of equality before the law. Far from stamping out profiteering during a national crisis, the hostile power would create a special channel, enabling favoured interests to guzzle public money. Its hard to think of a better policy for destroying trust in public life and the sense that we are all in this together. You can see where this is going. It sometimes seems to me that if this government had set out to harm our country, it could scarcely have done a better job. It seems perversely committed to the destruction of civic life, national pride and a sense of belonging. You can more or less predict Tory policy on any issue by asking yourself: Whats the most toxic and harmful strategy they could hope to get away with? So what is going on? Has a hostile power managed to infiltrate the UK government? In a way, yes. That power is oligarchic capital. At the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that people who have donated at least £250,000 to the Conservative party have been invited to join an advisory board, with special access to the prime minister, cabinet ministers and senior government advisers. They have used this access to lobby for changes in government policy. The 14 identified members of the group have a combined wealth of at least £30bn, and have donated £22m to the Conservatives. Among them are property tycoons, financiers, two people with connections to the Kremlin, a tobacco magnate and an internet entrepreneur currently facing trial for rape and sexual assault (both of which he denies). The group and its agenda had hitherto been kept secret. The Sunday Times reporting was based on a trove of leaked documents. The advisory group appears to cross the line that separates party business from government business, especially as the official facilitating it is on the public payroll. We have also been told that the Conservative party is helping its donors to apply for key government positions, which looks like another obvious transgression of the line. Another tranche of leaked documents suggest that offering a golden ladder to prestigious public appointments is used as leverage when persuading them to part with their money. Political funding has long been a means by which the very rich can exercise inordinate influence over public policy. But this influence now seems to have become cruder and more extreme than at any time in living memory. Far from seeking to contain plutocratic power, Boris Johnson hopes to strip the Electoral Commission of its powers to stop abuses of the funding system. Big donors are not the only oligarchs with inordinate influence over this government. Dominic Cummings claimed that Boris Johnson referred to the Telegraph, owned by the billionaire Frederick Barclay, as my real boss. Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives have held several private meetings with Johnson and members of his cabinet. Are the very rich deliberately trying to harm our country? In some cases, perhaps. There is a strand of capitalism that wants to generate crises and then seize national assets at fire-sale prices. But no such intention is required to explain the general damage inflicted by oligarchic capital. It is simply that the interests of the very rich are not the same as the interests of the nation. We should never forget what the billionaire stockbroker Peter Hargreaves, who donated £3.2m to one of the leave campaigns, said about Brexit: We will get out there and we will become incredibly successful because we will be insecure again. And insecurity is fantastic. No responsible government would allow the demands of the ultra-rich to override the needs of the nation. But we have no responsible government."
57,"The World Economic Forum is looking to reduce global reliance on critical metals as nations look to make the transition to renewable energy supplies, and one proposal is reducing ownership of private vehicles. ""This transition from fossil fuels to renewables will need large supplies of critical metals such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, to name a few,"" the forum said in a report earlier this month. ""Shortages of these critical minerals could raise the costs of clean energy technologies."" The international lobbying organization based in Switzerland has proposed three solutions for lowering the costs of critical metals used in everything from cellphones and electric vehicles to wind turbines and efficient lighting. The forum noted that even with recycling initiatives in place mineral mining is expected to increase by 500% by 2050. ""More sharing can reduce ownership of idle equipment and thus material usage,"" the group argued, pointing to statistics that show the average vehicle in England is driven ""just 4% of the time."" Vehicle sharing initiatives like ""Getaround"" and ""BlueSG"" have become increasingly popular around the world and are key in reducing the number of cars and electronics needed globally, the forum argued. Though it did not address how car sharing could be more effectively utilized in a nation like the U.S. where cars are heavily relied on and public transportation is lacking in both rural and urban communities. The report also pointed out that most people around the world already have personal phones or computers but 39% of global workers are also provided laptops and mobile phones. ""This is not at all resource efficient,"" the report said. ""Keeping a smartphone for five years instead of three reduces the phones annual carbon footprint by 31%."" The report said companies need to be incentivized to reward consumer longevity and encourage product repurposing to prevent new mines from being opened."
198,"This article was written by the Economic Times editor, published in February 2019 at TruePublica. when Theresa May was Prime Minister, before the pandemic and Boris Johnsons populist agenda and subsequent dramatic fall from grace. This is a piece that predicted the ongoing failure of a political ideology that ran its course and subsequently went extreme to stay in power. This is a sobering read. It should make you think about where our country is being led right now and the dangers we now face. By Graham Vanbergen  13/02/2019: I have written endlessly about the scandal that is now emerging. The involvement of dark money and right-wing free-market fundamentalists who agitated for Brexit  secured positions in high office and the very corridors of power. In my book, Brexit  A corporate coup detat  I highlighted how they established, built and nurtured authoritative organisations to ensure that Brexit was not a wasted opportunity to push forward the next stage of the global reign of free markets. The books main thrust was to highlight just how much dark money from foreign donors  and by that, I mean many American donors  was used (illegally) to tip the balance in favour of leaving the EU. The difference between 52/48 and 50/50 was just 1.2 million votes. It is telling that one-third of those who voted in the EU referendum had not made up their mind just one week before walking into the voting booth. The type and style of covert influence that has had such serious implications for British democracy that I wrote about is now becoming known. The tactics and strategies used are truly shocking and would be in any democracy. The extent of that influence, two and half years after the fact, is now bubbling to the surface every day. The Electoral Commission, useless as it has proven to be, has been forced into action. The police are involved, and now so is the National Crime Agency. The NCAs mission statement is  Our role is to protect the public by disrupting and bringing to justice those serious and organised criminals who present the highest risk to the UK. The NCA is now looking into the organised crimes of the Leave campaign and its collective funding operations. There are a number of realities  or facts if you like that will become so. The Electoral Commission is toothless and will end up issuing meaningless fines. No one will take any notice. The police will do little  if anything at all, the same with the National Crime Agency. The reality of life is that as a billionaire or a corporation, there arent any rules and they can pay for what is in their best interest. They will not get caught. They will not go to prison. Just like the bankers. Fantasising Brexiteers dream of the vacuum that Theresa May is creating. That dream consists of a bonfire of deregulation because thats all there is with Brexit. But beware of the message that what this will bring us is freedom. It is their version of freedom they want, not yours. That is the deregulation of workers rights, of environmental protection legislation, of food standards, animal welfare, agricultural safeguards and so much more. Britain obtained many of these safeguards through the membership of a club that wasnt perfect  but it was a lot better than what will happen next. The question over EU membership has seen off Thatcher and Cameron. It will see off Theresa May  probably quite soon as her Brexit will simply not be hard enough for the more extreme end of the very powerful right-wing faction within the Tory ranks. Its next chosen Prime Minister will also fail. Whoever that sacrificial lamb turns out to be  he/she will end up being stabbed in the back by the Tories just a couple of years into their leadership. And then another Tory PM will be crowned  and it will see him/her off as well, probably at the hands of the electorate  eventually Brexit is an ideology. It is not a thought-out, written down, published economic plan that we can analyse. It will cause trade to fall significantly between the UK and the EU. It will be so bad that a recession will likely build with GDP falling over a period of at least a decade. Relations will become toxic because the hard right within the Tory party will blame the EU for all of the failures of itself and what will inevitably turn into some form of a political party of extreme cultists. They want you to be with them or against them  its all they have. At some point, the hard Brexit they will end up achieving will cause huge political and constitutional problems  not least with border controls and of course, threaten the four-nation Union of Britain itself. The former could see just-in-time deliveries of all manner of goods from food to pharmaceuticals to fail. The latter will be a gift to the SNP in Scotland, who will demand another referendum at some point in the near future. And who knows  Ireland? Wales? Eventually, the wheels will start to fall off UK plc. Britains currency will continue in the doldrums for years, international investors will seek more stable markets abroad and as the economy begins a slow downward spiral against its peers, a recession will turn more inflationary (as a result of the decline of Sterlings buying power). Theres even a possibility that in a few years time, Britain could enter a period of stagflation. That is stagnant growth not keeping up with inflation. As the meltdown builds, Jeremy Corbyns hard-left toxicity will not resonate with the electorate, as Ive said before. The right-wing press will ensure a true blue fear factor propaganda campaign is well in full swing before any general election, whenever that might be. And the Tories will be victorious and claim another five years  and that will prove to be an awful spectacle of political policy failure at every level. Just a litany of broken promises. But in the end, all of this means  standards of living will fall. Poverty-stricken households will increase, food banks will become so common they will emerge in the most unlikely places like GPs surgeries, libraries and other public buildings. The cost of maintaining a basic standard of life for households will eventually see people on the streets. Household incomes have been falling in real terms since the banks crashed the economy. This will not stop  and Brexit will make it worse. The elderly will demand more care, more assistance, more money  and as they outnumber the young, their outdated worldview and dreams of an era long gone  will bring us down even more so. This is where the rise of populism festers  in the minds of those who wish for the things that are simply not possible. Britain is already in a tailspin, and by the time the electorate realises it  theres a crash-landing ahead. Itll be a problem for everyone but the rich. Mark my words, Brexit was a con, neoliberal capitalism (the manipulation of real capitalism tilted towards the rich and powerful) is a con and were heading for a generation of political and economic trouble, especially as the middle classes get eviscerated to pay for all the damage. Predictions are difficult to get right at the best of times  but the only potential I can see for Brexit is that something even worse happens  like a world war or some other global catastrophe that changes the world order  that crushes the old alliances and changes international pacts like the European Union and even Pax Americana. But still, you need great leadership  and I dont see that in any corner of the current Conservative party. They are dead in the water as a political party  they just dont know it yet."
191,"Air Source Heat Pumps are an increasingly popular way to heat up homes. They work equally well as the primary source of heat in the home or as a supplement to existing heating systems. They provide affordable heating all year round and a reliably constant source of hot water. Heat pumps are not just another form of heating. They are materially different from the standard methods we use to heat our homes. Most sources of heat rely on the generation of heat and its distribution around the property. However, heat pumps simply move existing heat into your home. Since they do not spend resources on creating heat, they are less expensive and more efficient than most comparable solutions. They are also a remarkably green solution for your heating needs. They produce more energy than they consume, and therefore, they reduce your energy bills and qualify you for energy-saving government grants. However, despite their many advantages, Air Source Heat Pumps are not a solution for everyone. Read on to see if these remarkable units are suitable for your needs. Air Source Heat Pump Cost Breakdown The system tends to cost more than its new gas or oil-fired central heating system equivalents. However, a sound heat pump system will more than make up for it by saving on energy bills. Keep in mind that because it does not generate energy independently, the air source heat pump produces more energy than it consumes electricity. Their overall efficiency can be three or four times higher than most other heating systems. Product Cost An air-source heat pump costs anywhere between £4,000-8,000 depending on the model and its output capacity. You may find yourself paying to improve the insulation of your home as well. Keep in mind that heat pumps are not particularly useful unless you have high-quality insulation. However, the systems are made by a variety of different companies, and their pricing schemes vary considerably. For example, a Mitsubishi unit costs between £2000 and £5000 without installation. Meanwhile, Daikin and Samsung units typically cost about £1000 less. The unit with the best reviews and reputation is the Nibe F2040. They are smart units integrated into your phone and immediately alert you if anything goes wrong. They also have the best specs in terms of energy savings and cut the bills immediately and dramatically. However, these cost a good deal more than the competition, fetching £7000 without figuring in installation. Installation Cost The installation of an air source heat pump costs £1,000-2,000. Therefore, the process will likely cost you £5,000-£10,000 at the end of the day. However, if you install ground source heat pumps, the system will cost significantly more. The process requires installing pipes beneath the ground and may cost somewhere between £11,000 and £15,000. What Impacts the installation Cost Price The main factors contractors will take into account when giving you a quote on Air Source Heat Pump system will include, but are not limited to: The size of the home The degree of insulation in the home The pump size you require The brand of the pump and unit The pumps performance specs Your desired room temperature Aside from the installation itself, other factors will affect your financial outlay. The installation of an Air Source Heat Pump system often requires the overall upgrade of other elements in your home, such as the insulation and existing heating infrastructure. For example, if your home heating is based on electrical storage heaters, you may need to install new pipes and radiators throughout your home. If your home has a central heating system, the overhaul will be less drastic. However, you may still want to upgrade to larger radiators and install underfloor heating. As a general rule of the thumb, the older your home and heating infrastructure are, the more expensive this system is to install. It is often less expensive to install an Air Source Heat Pump system in a house that is being newly built than an existing one. This is especially relevant for ground source heat pumps, which require digging and are easier to put in with the foundations than later. Therefore, a good proportion of newly built homes are fitted for Air Source Heat Pump systems. The size of your home and its layout will also have a significant impact on the price. The installation for a detached house is estimated at £8000 to £16000. Meanwhile, installation in a terraced unit or semi-detached house can cost £7000 to £10000. The process is most affordable in a flat and should run about £6000 to £8000. How Do Air Source Heat Pumps Work? Air Source Heat Pumps are kind of amazing. They take the air blowing outside, no matter how cold it may be, and transform it into hot air that is then transmitted around the home. In the process, they produce about three times as much energy as they consume. The secret is in its use of energy that already exists in the environment instead of creating its own. External air is blown through a system of tubes. The system fills the air with a refrigerant, which helps transform it from liquid to gas. The gas undergoes compression, which adds heat as it passes through a heat exchanger. The exchanger is surrounded by cool air, which turns warm and is then circulated around the home. In the meantime, the refrigerant returns to its cool liquid state and restarts the process, heating the entire property in the process. There are two types of pumps. One is an air-to-water system, which relies on radiators or an underfloor heating system. In another variation, they can heat water through a storage tank. The second is the air-to-air systems, which typically use fans to circulate air. Many people prefer the first system since the second variety cannot be used to heat water. The system uses electricity. However, it is still considered a renewable system. That is because the air running through the Air Source Heat Pumps is heated by the sun. Therefore, the system is environmentally friendly and recognized as such by the UK government for grant purposes. Pros & Cons Like any home heating system, Air Source Heat Pumps have advantages and disadvantages. There are significant advantages the system has over most comparable systems: It is a very efficient source of heat and hot water for most homes. If you use an Air Source Heat Pump with a renewable tariff, it will have no carbon imprint whatsoever. Saves on energy bills in the long term. It participates in the Renewable Heat Incentive program, and therefore, installation costs are offset by payments. The system is low-maintenance and typically lasts a long time without breaking down. The better Air Source Heat Pump Systems will also cool your home in the summer. The system is very safe as it does not introduce flammable or explosive materials. It is one of the safest heating systems out there. The system does not require gas pipes to work. Therefore, it is probably the best heating system for homes that cannot or prefer not to link up to the gas system. However, an Air Source Heat Pump system is not the right fit for every home. It has some significant downsides, including: The temperature emitted is lower than most conventional boilers  therefore, it could require investment in larger radiators and improved insulation. Need outdoor space and can be noisy. Expensive to install and works best with a water tank. Dont work as efficiently in extremely cold weather. When the temperature outside is less than 0°C, it does not operate at total efficiency or capacity. At below -20°C, the unit will not work correctly. Air Source Heat Pump systems require a good deal of space, comparable to a large air conditioner, which can be a problem for smaller flats and units. It can be particularly problematic if you have a small garden space which the equipment would curtail. It is a reasonably noisy installation, and if you live in a quiet environment, the sound can be noticeable. Can Air Source Heat Pumps Save You Money? The short answer is yes. Energy bills with Air Source Heat Pumps will inevitably be significantly lower because you do not have to spend any money on generating heat within the system. However, the exact amount of savings will vary from home to home, depending on size and insulation. However, users have reported saving anywhere over 25% on their heating bills and sometimes far more than water heating expenses. If we take a typical 4-room house as an example and compare the bills from other heating sources to those associated with Air Source Heat Pumps, we get the following results: If you are switching from an old gas boiler, you can save about £560£650 annually When switching from an old oil boiler, you may save about £930£1,100 annually If you switch from an old oil boiler, you can save about £1,365£1,610 annually. Remember that if you have a newer and more efficient version of any of these systems, you may be saving significantly less. However, an Air Source Heat Pump system is more efficient than any of these other systems, even at their highest level of performance. Air Source Heat Pumps will also save you money on service and replacements compared to most equivalents. They are notoriously reliable and usually last well over 20 years when properly maintained. However, to ensure that it is operating at the highest performance level, it should be serviced and examined every few years. One of the great things about the system is that you can perform a lot of the maintenance yourself, even if you are not DIY-minded. A lot of the attention the system requires is non-technical and straightforward. For example, you need to constantly make sure that a plentiful supply of air is available. You will have to check for leaves and rubbish and keep plants from growing near the unit. While a bit of a pain, all of this maintenance is free! Are There Grants Available? The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) grant covers Air Source Heat Pumps. To qualify, all you need is to conform to the following standards: Generate heat from a renewable source (such as Air Source Heat Pumps). Use your Air Source Heat Pumps system to serve a single household. This initiative was launched by the government to reduce UK carbon emissions and hit its renewable energy targets. Some heat pump system owners are set to receive £1,300 per year annually according to current standards. One of the best ways to use the RHI resources is by appropriating them to the upfront cost of installation. Many installers participate in the grant system and will help you reduce upfront costs by using it. What is the Bottom Line? We do not recommend using Air Source Heat Pumps as the primary heating source in older and less insulated homes. In those cases, it may struggle to keep the house as warm as you would like. Therefore, you may want to combine it as part of a hybrid system and integrate it with a conventional boiler in older and less energy-efficient homes. Another issue is the performance of Air Source Heat Pumps in freezing climates. If you live in a particularly frigid area, you may find yourself struggling to keep the home appropriately warm. Fortunately, the average UK winter temperature is in range of the best performance levels of these units. However, they will struggle in really tough winters. However, if your house is a modern and well-insulated home located in a temperate weather zone, an Air Source Heat Pump may be the right solution for you. It will save you a bundle of money, and you will be significantly contributing to a greener future by lowering your carbon footprint."
141,"Things are about to get worse with the cost of living crisis, which is primarily being driven by energy costs. Brent crude, the international benchmark, hit $120.50 a barrel, up 1 per cent ahead of the July contracts expiry on Tuesday. The fall back in the price was temporary and is now the highest price for the last two months. This means petrol and diesel prices are likely to move up even higher than they already are in the UK and reach new record prices. As the summer months get underway, demand for petrol and diesel ramps up for the holiday season  and projections so far see no reductions against pre-pandemic years. Lingering concerns over supplies from Russia have not helped. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose by a similar amount to more than $116 a barrel. The rally in crude oil comes as supplies of refined products, such as gasoline, remain tight at major delivery hubs at a time when demand is expected to pick up steam in many countries, including the US The gas oil contract in Europe, a proxy for diesel and other distillates, is trading close to record levels near $1,200 a tonne. Motorists in many countries are now paying record prices at the pumps for diesel and petrol despite crude being well below its all-time high of $147.50 a barrel, which it hit in 2008. Lower exports of diesel from Russia, have tightened markets even more so than crude. The Opec+ group have not responded to these price hikes and has refused to accelerate oil production increases. The group meets this Thursday and is widely expected to stick with its plan of raising production by about 400,000 barrels a month, a target that has been in place since last year. Under these pressures, plus the Russia/Ukraine war, inflation more widely  petrol and diesel prices do not look like they will retreat any time soon."
200,"A new report on school absence by Englands Childrens Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, estimates there were 1.7m pupils persistently absent in the autumn 2021 term compared to over 900,000 children in autumn 2020. The Government needs to ensure that councils have enough funding and powers to help ensure that all children are able to access full-time education, local authority leaders say. The Childrens Commissioner identified a number of factors causing absences from school, including bullying, poor mental or physical health, and poor local Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) provision, and said these were flags that the education and care system is not working for every child in England. Responding to the report, Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the Local Government Associations (LGA) Children and Young People Board, urged the Government to do more to help councils provide wraparound support for children. Councils want to ensure every child attends school, however the safety net that schools and councils provide to ensure that children do not miss out on their entitlement to education is stretched to capacity, exacerbated by a lack of resources and powers available to councils to fulfil their statutory duties  which worsened as a result of the pandemic, said Cllr Bramble. To tackle this, we would like the Government to work to raise the profile of children missing formal full-time education, and resource councils adequately to fulfil their responsibilities in ensuring all children receive a suitable education. This should include adequate funding for local services to work together to provide wraparound support for childrens mental health. Councils also need powers to hold schools to account for the support they provide to pupils with SEND, to boost mainstream inclusion. At no time has the situation with school attendance been as bad as 1 in 4 pupils with an attendance rate of below 90% across a school year. It may well be that Covid19 exacerbated this by closing schools and making it difficult to re-open."
130,"Forget transitory. Forget the soft landing. Reality is setting in that the markets and the economy will not get out of the Federal Reserves aggressive battle against inflation without a recession. About the only question now is how bad it gets. Even Fed Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to concede the point last week after announcing the central banks third consecutive 75 basis point hike in interest rates, the medicine it has prescribed for the rampant inflation. No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be, Powell told reporters following the announcement. Thats going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored and also if we get more labor supply. Markets have already made up their mind on how this movie ends. Following Friday's 486-point selloff, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week at its lowest point since 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the economy. Bond yields rose, meanwhile, sending Treasuries to 11-year highs with the 10-year near 3.7% and the 2-year yield above 4.1%. The fact investors are asking for more on the shorter duration bond says they think the economy faces greater risk in the short term than the future. Wells Fargo Corporate and Investment Bank Econometrician Azhar Iqbal and Economic Analyst Nicole Cervi wrote on Friday that a recession in the next year is more likely than not, in our view. We do not believe the U.S. economy is in a recession at present, they added. Our forecast calls for a recession starting in Q1-2023 with three consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth and output growth turning positive in Q4-2023. The Fed is hoping that raising interest rates will cool economic demand enough to dampen the still-strong labor market and its recent projections see the unemployment rate reaching 3.9% in 2023 and 4.1 in 2024 from its current 3.7%. But no one really knows what level of job losses it will take to arrest wage inflation at a time when the labor force is facing significant demographic changes. One area of the economy that is already seeing the effects of the Feds moves is housing. As mortgage rates have reached levels that are double what they were a year ago, sales of existing homes have slumped for seven straight months and are now down about 20% from a year ago. Prices, meanwhile, are no longer rising at the pace they were in 2021. Its quite a turnaround for the Fed and the Biden White House, which held on to the idea of inflation as transitory throughout most of 2021 even as consumer prices began their ascent to levels not seen since the 1980s. Massive fiscal and monetary stimulus engineered by Congress and the Fed juiced the economy, and then the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February of this year drove energy prices and overall inflation upward. Until recently, the markets seemed skeptical that the Fed really meant it in terms of squeezing the economy hard enough to break inflation, forcing Powell to hammer the point home in August at the Feds summer symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct, Powell said, while not taking any questions. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth. Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. The markets sold off after Powell spoke, but then recovered somewhat as traders still believed the Fed would perhaps ease back in early 2023. Last week, the markets threw in the towel with the Feds September meeting ending with the third consecutive 75 basis point hike in interest rates. The Fed did more than just raise interest rates. It provided an update to its economic forecast and sharply reduced the outlook for the near term. Growth in the nations gross domestic product was revised downward for 2022, falling from 1.7% as recently as June to 0.2% now. Forecasts for 2023 were trimmed and the Fed now says the economy will operate below trend growth until 2025. The impression one gets from the (revised forecasts) and Powells remarks is that the (Fed) is in for a very challenging few years and is operating in uncharted waters, Robert Eisenbeis, vice chairman & chief monetary economist at Cumberland Advisors, wrote last week. On Sunday, in an appearance on CBS Face the Nation, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic sounded a positive note, saying: I do think that were going to do all that we can at the Federal Reserve to avoid deep, deep pain. The government will release updated inflation data for August on Friday from the personal consumption expenditure price index, a measure that is closely followed by the Fed. Forecasts are for the PCE to show a drop to a 6% annual rate from its current 6.3%, although there is a chance the month-over-month data will post a small increase. Its not just the U.S. that is feeling the pain. Europe is facing high inflation, an energy crisis from its dependence on Russian gas, and weakened currencies from a dollar that has rallied as the rest of the world suffers. In the U.K., where the Bank of England has already declared a recession is underway, new Prime Minister Liz Truss proposed tax cuts were met with a drop in the markets and the pounds value."
2,"Even though Latinos are the second-largest ethnic group in the U.S., theyre underrepresented across many industries, including finance, which can have long-term effects on the ability to grow wealth. A group of Latino-led and focused venture capital firms is looking to change that. There are more than 62 million Hispanic or Latino people in the U.S., according to the 2020 Census. Thats nearly 19% of the total population, second only to non-Hispanic whites. They also represent one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors: In 2019, the total economic output of the group was $2.7 trillion, up from $1.7 trillion in 2010, according to a report from the Latino Donor Collaborative. Lea este artículo en español aquí. But in 2021, Latinos made up only 4% of large U.S. companies most senior executives, per a survey from the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility. And a separate study in 2019 by the CFA Institute found that only 8% of workers in investment management firms were Latino compared to 9% Asian, 5% Black and 84% white. Similarly, only 2% of venture capital professionals and partner-level professionals at institutional firms are Latino, a study from LatinxVC discovered. Were trying to increase [Latino] venture capitalists within established venture organizations, said Mariela Salas, the executive director of LatinxVC. Were also trying to retain those Latinos that are in institutional and smaller firms. The investing gap Latinos also are less likely to have access to investing. Latino household wealth lags that of white counterparts, and only 26% of Hispanic households have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, compared to 37% of Black households and half of white ones, the Economic Policy Institute found. Lack of access to capital markets makes it harder for Latinos to build meaningful wealth. It also means theyre underrepresented as shareholders of companies if they arent holding stocks and that theyre not lending a proportional voice to investing decisions. We should be mindful of the connection of finance and the capital markets to the broader economy, said Rodrigo Garcia, global chief financial officer of Talipot Holdings, an investment management group. Its always been a critical piece that we have representation in asset management, in the people who are making decisions on the purchases of stocks, bonds, venture capital private equity and more. Latino-focused venture capital There are several Latino-focused venture capital firms that are working on at least one piece of the puzzle: investing in their communities. One of those firms is the Boston Impact Initiative, which just launched a $20 million fund focused on investing in entrepreneurs of color. We take the earliest risk, were funding the teeny-tiny startups that hopefully one day will grow into those companies that become publicly traded and become available in the retail finance sector, said Betty Francisco, CEO of the Boston Impact Initiative. Those businesses include Synergy Contracting, a women-owned construction company, and Roundhead Brewing, the first Latino-owned craft brewery in Massachusetts. Another group, Mendoza Ventures, was started in 2016 to address the lack of both women and Latinos writing checks to fund new companies. The Boston-based firm run by Adrian Mendoza has raised $10 million across two funds. We give the opportunity to first-time accredited investors, people of color and women to get access to venture capital, Mendoza said. Accredited investors are individuals or entities that meet specific earned income, net worth or asset thresholds in order to invest in sophisticated or complex securities. The majority of wealth in America comes from [mergers and acquisitions] and that comes through venture capital and private equity, so why not be able to diversify on the other end? Mendoza added. What investors can do To be sure, there has been some progress in the financial industry. In 2021, the number of Latino certified financial planners rose by 15% from the prior year. Still, of the overall class of professionals who passed the exam that year, only 2.7% identified as Latino. Those in the industry see that theres a benefit to having more people with diverse experiences in all areas of finance. You cannot replicate anyones lived experience, said Marcela Pinilla, director of sustainable investing at Zevin Asset Management. She added that as a Latina in finance, she wants to bring more people of color into the industry. From the perspective of the retail investors themselves, one of the most powerful things they can do is look at what theyre investing in and ask how many of those dollars are going to Latino fund managers, Latino-led funds or even companies with Hispanic leadership. I think just the simple question of who is managing my money? is important, said Mendoza."
59,"Some hints that U.S. price pressures are beginning to ease even as overall inflation remains high could encourage Federal Reserve policymakers to opt for smaller interest rate increases after they deliver a fourth straight supersized hike next week. While the Commerce Department reported on Friday that underlying inflation pressures remained stubbornly high last month, the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index showed a considerable slowdown in private-sector wage growth in the third quarter - it rose 1.2% compared to 1.6% in the second quarter - suggesting the likelihood of a scenario of ever-rising wages pushing prices higher may be receding. Fed policymakers are keenly attentive to the ECI as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation. ""Although another 75bp (basis point) rate hike lies in store next week, we suspect that slowdown (in wage growth) will help convince the Fed to slow the pace of tightening in December,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. With the U.S. central bank almost certain to lift its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range at its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, investors are now focused on what's coming in December and early 2023. Projections released last month showed policymakers' median forecast for the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 at 4.6%. Fed officials have said they expect to hit that level by early next year and several then want to pause, arguing that the economy will need time to absorb the fastest pace of tightening in 40 years and that an easing in inflation is likely to lag the rate hikes. Several policymakers in the last month have also appeared to be leaning toward a smaller rate hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate were little changed after the release of Friday's data, still pricing in a half-percentage-point hike next month and another 50 basis points over the first two meetings of next year. INFLATION STILL HIGH Whether the Fed will be able to stick to its preferred path of a pause around 4.6% remains to be seen. Certainly, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data did little to bolster central bank hopes that price pressures have decisively turned a corner. The PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure as it tracks progress in reducing inflation to its 2% target, increased 0.3% on a month-to-month basis and 6.2% on a year-to-year basis in September, matching the advances in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was up 0.5% in September, matching the gain in the prior month, and 5.1% in the 12 months through September, compared to a 4.9% year-on-year rise in August. That was enough for one analyst to argue the market is undershooting the amount of Fed tightening that remains. ""Inflation is still running way too hot, the month-on-month numbers are holding steady ... the numbers also show that the Fed is going to have to continue to raise rates and tighten probably longer than the market is pricing in currently,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors."
136,"The secretive think tanks behind more than a dozen campaign pledges of Liz Truss have proposed cost-of-living solutions including scrapping childcare regulations, abandoning net zero, allowing AI to diagnose patients and abolishing the energy price cap altogether. Between them, the Truss-backed think tanks have also lobbied against a windfall tax on gas and oil companies, called for a windfall tax on renewables firms instead, and urged ministers to cut taxes rather than provide further support for those who will struggle with soaring bills this winter. Analysis by openDemocracy has identified a string of Truss policies and campaign staff originating from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), the Adam Smith Institute and the Centre for Policy Studies. MPs and campaigners have raised the alarm about Trusss closeness to the groups, saying a government led by the Conservative frontrunner would be a puppet for the organisations Truss is particularly close to the IEA, having founded its parliamentary wing FREER in 2011 and hired its former communications director to run her campaign. Her policies to scrap the planned rise in corporation tax, crack down on the right to strike, review inheritance tax, loosen financial solvency regulation and deregulate the childcare sector were all first proposed by the IEA. None of the think tanks discloses its funders, but the IEA has received donations from BP and ExxonMobil and, along with the Adam Smith Institute and the Centre for Policy Studies, the tobacco industry. The IEA and the Adam Smith Institute have also received millions of dollars from US funders of climate denial. SNP MP Deidre Brock said that Truss lifting a number of her policies from the think tanks raises worrying questions about the functioning of our democracy, the impact of dark money on UK politics and the allegiances of Boris Johnsons potential successor. Liz Truss must immediately answer concerns about her close personal connections with these organisations and the lack of transparency around their donors, she said. The Labour MP Clive Lewis added: Truss being a puppet for dark money interests is, unfortunately, the rule of how British politics is done, and not an exception to it. The government has the power and tools needed to address the cost of living crisis  for example, through extending the windfall tax, nationalising utilities, funding a mass home retrofit, and establishing universal basic income and services. The only reason such a programme will not be delivered is because it will not favour the private interests who are benefiting from the cost of living crisis, such as the funders of dark money think tanks that appear to be driving the incoming Truss governments agenda. Charities campaigning for increases to Universal Credit in response to the cost of living crisis have condemned the IEA after it referred to them as a poverty lobby in July and dismissed benefits aimed at alleviating poverty as handouts. Neil Cowan, policy and campaigner manager at the Poverty Alliance, said that anyone opposing an anti-poverty campaign is the real poverty lobby. People in the UK believe in justice and compassion, he said. They believe everyone has a right to a dignified, secure life. Putting those values into practice is not difficult  business can pay people a real living wage, and social security can be strengthened to keep people out of the grip of poverty. Anyone opposed to those policies is opposed to freedom, dignity, compassion, and justice. Truss being a puppet for dark money interests is, unfortunately, the rule of how British politics is done The IEAs list of policy prescriptions to address the cost of living crisis, published in July, pushed for a windfall tax on the renewables industry and an end to the UKs target to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. A serious approach would stop putting Net Zero targets at the heart of policy, preferring instead efforts to align market carbon prices internally and with our industrial peers, writes its chief operating officer and energy analyst Andy Mayer. The IEAs former deputy research director Richard Wellings was criticised last week after saying pensioners could burn wood, old books etc to stay warm. The think tank also called for removing or reducing regulatory requirements on nurseries, which include regular inspections by the education watchdog Ofsted. Helen Donohoe, policy manager at the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years, said the proposals were a reductive hash of already rejected ideas. The prospect of these proposals reaching anything like a serious discussion in government is eye-wateringly worrying, she said. For early years and childcare they represent a surrender of all that we have gained, for children and for parents, in the name of shoddily substantiated claims to cutting costs. Truss pledges to end the ban on fracking and reduce the size of the government have been lobbied for by the Adam Smith Institute, where her longest-serving special adviser previously worked. Meanwhile, her plan to create free ports and full-fat investment zones  where business rates and regulation are suspended altogether  echo the Centre For Policy Studies 2019 proposal to create opportunity zones. Her vow to scrap green levies from energy bills was also first called for by the think tank in May. Another advisor of Liz Truss previously worked for the CPS and she has regularly given speeches at the think tank, which was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher. Campaigners say if Truss goes ahead with all three of the think tanks tax plans it would mean less money to support families, less cash for the NHS and social care. This is a cost of living scandal. The last thing Liz Truss should do is cut taxes for the biggest most profitable companies while some people are choosing between heating and eating, said Tax Justices executive director, Robert Palmer. Liz Truss is widely expected to be the winner when the new Conservative leader and prime minister is announced today. openDemocracy approached the Truss campaign for comment but it had not responded at the time of publication."
189,"A report generated by the government and published to the House of Commons library, looked into the attitudes of the over 50s, their working lives and thoughts about retirement. Whilst it found some rather obvious points it also raised some interesting points (source). Dont forget that since this report was generated (the last one), the retirement age as of 2020 is 66 for men and women and then 67 by 2028. By far the leading reason for not retiring was needing to earn money (31 per cent). Following this, I think Im too young to stop was the second most common response (13 per cent), while I enjoy the work I do was third (9 per cent). The proportion of respondents who claimed the dominant reason for not being retired was enjoyment of work increased significantly with age; 5 per cent among those in their 50s, 15 per cent among those in their 60s and rising to 33 per cent of those aged 70 plus. Here are some more interesting thoughts from those not retired yet but thinking about the future. The average age at which respondents thought they would stop working and retire was 65.2 (for men and women). At the time, the retirement age was 65. Fifty six per cent said that they now expect to retire later than planned. Thirty nine per cent of respondents not currently retired said that working part time or flexible hours before stopping work altogether would be the best way to retire. Seventeen per cent preferred a less demanding job before retiring altogether, while the same proportion said working full time and then stopping work altogether would be the best way to retire. Fifteen per cent of respondents not currently retired and under 60 years old would like to stop work altogether and retire between the ages of 60 and 65 while 74 per cent would like to be in work still (either full time or part time). Forty per cent of those not currently retired and under 65 years old would like to be retired between the ages of 65 and 70, while 48 per cent would like to still be in work either full time or part time. About a third of those currently not retired said they had some interest in moving to self-employment (33 per cent) or starting a new career (36 per cent). Of these that had retired, there was some experience and advice for those thinking about it. Forty six per cent of those who had retired said that they had retired earlier than planned, 44 per cent said that they had retired at the age they planned, and 11 per cent said they had retired later than planned. More than one in five (22 per cent) of those who had retired miss work and just under a quarter (23 per cent) wished they had worked longer before retiring. Thirty nine per cent of people who had retired said that they dont miss anything about work but 38 per cent said that they miss the social interaction, and 27 per cent said they miss the income. Thirty six per cent of people who had retired said that they would advise someone who was thinking about stopping work altogether and retiring to consider switching to flexible or part time work for a period first, 20 per cent said If you can, take a break from work and then make a decision, while 32 per cent said they would advise retirement. What all of this says is that when you reach mid life, you have to start thinking about the future. If possible, make plans in case of the unexpected and if not, keep learning new skills to make you more indispensable or more attractive to other employers. Dont forget that more than half of people now think they will retire later than planned and almost as many were expecting to be working part-time  mainly to supplement incomes."
115,"The Federal Reserves favored measure of inflation remained unchanged in September, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported on Friday. However, the core index, leaving out often volatile food and energy costs, rose to a 5.1% annual rate from Augusts 4.9% level. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell often points to the core PCE as a barometer of inflation when discussing monetary policy. Personal spending rose 0.6% in September, showing consumers still have some firepower left. Rate hikes? What rate hikes? Personal Income & Outlays show Americans increase spending and made more money in September at a pace above estimates, Navy Federal Credit Union Corporate Economist Robert Frick tweeted. The report is the last government reading on inflation before the Fed meets on Tuesday to consider monetary policy. Most analysts expect that two-day meeting will conclude with the central bank raising rates by 75 basis points as it continues its campaign against inflation. On Thursday, the government reported that gross domestic product increased by 2.6% annually in the third quarter, though there were signs of a slowdown. The housing sector has been hit by high mortgage rates and there are weaknesses in retail and the tech industry. Amazon on Thursday forecast weak fourth quarter sales, suggesting the upcoming holiday season would not be as robust as some retailers had hoped. The key to our outlook is what path inflation will take, says Steve Wyett, chief investment strategist at BOK Financial. If the Fed raises rates and slows down the economy, then inflation will come down. The question, though, is at what cost. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the regime of higher interest rates will bring pain to business and consumers alike, and that could take the form of increased unemployment and a recession. Already, Powell is feeling political heat from Democrats worried about the effect on higher interest rates as they also try to deflect blame for inflation that is running at an 8.2% annual rate. Raising rates now when prices may come down would be foolish and damaging to American consumers and small businesses, Colorado Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper wrote in a letter to Powell Thursday, adding that the Feds actions so far have failed to knock inflation down. There have been meaningful declines in prices in some areas of the economy. Housing prices are now rising at a 13% annual rate compared to 20% at their peak earlier this year. Gasoline prices have fallen more than $1 a gallon from their $5 peak this summer. But what concerns economists and the Fed is that inflation has spread from the goods sector to the services part of the economy and the labor market remains tight, putting pressure on employers to increase wages. Dan Wantrobski, technical director at Janney Montgomery Scott, says that the economy has largely shed the main effects of the coronavirus, with supply chain disruptions easing and businesses operating closer to normal. The U.S. economy is running hot, he says. I think it is going to continue hot. Beyond the amount that the Fed hikes rates next week, observers will be looking for what Powell says in his press conference about the economy and future monetary policy. Markets are hoping for signs the Fed could be poised for a halt, or reduction, in the amount of interest rate increases as it assesses what effect its aggressive tightening has had on the economy."
163,"It now looks ever more likely that gas prices will stay high for years, but petrol prices should fall back sooner, according to new analysis. This, of course, might not be the same for diesel prices at the pump. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has ominously warned that the cost of heating your house on gas may well stay up for years rather than months. This is a situation made clear by the loss of Russian supplies and the following infrastructure challenges in replacing them. At the moment  key energy allies, those from the Gulf states, for example, have decided not to play ball in Western markets. However, the CEBR did say that there was some hope for early relief at the petrol stations. It takes the view that by facing those infrastructure challenges means the price of oil should fall by the end of the year. We have all been witness to the connection of rising energy prices since Russias invasion of Ukraine amid uncertainty about supplies. This has caused an escalation in prices at the pump and home heating costs. Russia is by far the biggest exporter of oil and oil products to global markets. It also supplies about 40 per cent of Europes gas. As a direct result of Russias attack on Ukraine  western buyers have ended up boycotting Russian oil. The United States has imposed an oil embargo and released huge reserves to calm markets. Rising Covid cases in China is causing energy demand to fall and increased production elsewhere should see strategic stockpiles being released and high prices denting demand. The CEBR also said its models were predicting Brent back below $90 a barrel in 2024 and that much of that fall is forecast by December 2022. FairFuelUK said this should translate to a reduction of 8p a litre in prices at the pump. Brent was at about $104 a barrel last night. However, it still remains the fact that home heating via gas, will heavily erode disposable income for the foreseeable future. Until terminals are built and operating and demand is reduced, Europe has to choose between facing a recession and continuing to buy Russian gas, the CEBR said."
166,"A very closely monitored survey, the purchasing managers index, compiled by S&P Global and the Chartered Institute for Procurement and Supply (CIPS) has found that British manufacturing growth expanded at its weakest pace in more than a year in March. Whether this is a trend building or a blip is to be determined but recent data shows British exports to the EU have fallen dramatically in 2021. The slowdown was driven by a fall in output and in new orders. This also showed that orders had dropped to their lowest level since January 2021. The monthly purchasing managers index, fell to a 13-month low of 55.2. This index is a barometer of economic health in many respects. It remains above 50, which separates growth from contraction, but below the 55.5 predicted by economists. It is a sharp drop from the index score of 58 recorded in February just before Russias invasion of Ukraine. The survey shows that manufacturers are losing confidence in the general outlook and prospects for their businesses despite disruption to supply chains having eased and exports having dropped relatively little since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine,. Business optimism dropped to a 14-month low and the index for new export orders fell slightly to 49.4 from 49.6  the survey of 650 manufacturers between March 11 and 28 found Companies in the sector were less confident in hiring new staff last month bringing the employment index down to 56.7 from 57.9. Many economists and forecasters are predicting that the second half of 2022 will show the economy starting to show signs of heading towards a recession or at the very least of growth slowing behind competitors and manufacturing growth is a key indicator of those forecasts."
