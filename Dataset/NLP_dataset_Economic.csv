Elon Musk says a global recession could last until the spring of 2024,"Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk thinks the global economic decline could last for another year and a half. In a Twitter exchange early Friday morning Eastern time, the mercurial electric car executive and world’s richest man said a recession could continue “until spring of ’24.” The remarks came in response to a tweet from Shibetoshi Nakamoto, the online name for Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who noted that current coronavirus numbers “are actually pretty low. i [sic] guess all we have to worry about now is the impending global recession and nuclear apocalypse.” “It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event,” Musk replied. Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a Twitter account with nearly 600,000 followers, then asked Musk how long he thought the recession would last, to which he replied, “Just guessing, but probably until spring of ’24.” Global GDP grew 6% in 2021 but is expected to decelerate to 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. That would mark the weakest pace of growth since 2001 outside of the financial crisis in 2008 and the brief plunge in the early days of the Covid pandemic. The Federal Reserve projects GDP in the U.S. to grow just 0.2% this year and 1.2% in 2023. Musk becomes the latest corporate titan to express reservations about the economy. In a tweet Wednesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said it’s time to “batten down the hatches” in preparation for rough economic waters ahead. That tweet accompanied a video of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who said in a CNBC interview that he thinks there’s a “good chance” of a recession in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also has been warning of economic turmoil ahead. Musk’s comment also came amid a rough week for Tesla stock as the automaker missed revenue estimates and cautioned about a potential delivery shortfall this year. During the analyst call, Musk expressed more confidence in the U.S. economy than other parts of the world. He also noted the impact that interest rate increases are having on the economy. “The U.S. actually is in — North America’s in pretty good health,” he said. “A little bit of that is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down, I think.” However, he said China is in “quite a burst of a recession of sorts” driven by the real estate market, while Europe “has a recession of sorts, driven by energy.""",agree
Here’s how venture capital is helping to lift the next generation of Latinos in finance,"Even though Latinos are the second-largest ethnic group in the U.S., they’re underrepresented across many industries, including finance, which can have long-term effects on the ability to grow wealth. A group of Latino-led and focused venture capital firms is looking to change that. There are more than 62 million Hispanic or Latino people in the U.S., according to the 2020 Census. That’s nearly 19% of the total population, second only to non-Hispanic whites. They also represent one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors: In 2019, the total economic output of the group was $2.7 trillion, up from $1.7 trillion in 2010, according to a report from the Latino Donor Collaborative. Lea este artículo en español aquí. But in 2021, Latinos made up only 4% of large U.S. companies’ most senior executives, per a survey from the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility. And a separate study in 2019 by the CFA Institute found that only 8% of workers in investment management firms were Latino compared to 9% Asian, 5% Black and 84% white. Similarly, only 2% of venture capital professionals and partner-level professionals at institutional firms are Latino, a study from LatinxVC discovered. “We’re trying to increase [Latino] venture capitalists within established venture organizations,” said Mariela Salas, the executive director of LatinxVC. “We’re also trying to retain those Latinos that are in institutional and smaller firms.” The investing gap Latinos also are less likely to have access to investing. Latino household wealth lags that of white counterparts, and only 26% of Hispanic households have access to an employer-sponsored 401(k) plan, compared to 37% of Black households and half of white ones, the Economic Policy Institute found. Lack of access to capital markets makes it harder for Latinos to build meaningful wealth. It also means they’re underrepresented as shareholders of companies if they aren’t holding stocks and that they’re not lending a proportional voice to investing decisions. “We should be mindful of the connection of finance and the capital markets to the broader economy,” said Rodrigo Garcia, global chief financial officer of Talipot Holdings, an investment management group. “It’s always been a critical piece that we have representation in asset management, in the people who are making decisions on the purchases of stocks, bonds, venture capital private equity and more.” Latino-focused venture capital There are several Latino-focused venture capital firms that are working on at least one piece of the puzzle: investing in their communities. One of those firms is the Boston Impact Initiative, which just launched a $20 million fund focused on investing in entrepreneurs of color. “We take the earliest risk, we’re funding the teeny-tiny startups that hopefully one day will grow into those companies that become publicly traded and become available in the retail finance sector,” said Betty Francisco, CEO of the Boston Impact Initiative. Those businesses include Synergy Contracting, a women-owned construction company, and Roundhead Brewing, the first Latino-owned craft brewery in Massachusetts. Another group, Mendoza Ventures, was started in 2016 to address the lack of both women and Latinos writing checks to fund new companies. The Boston-based firm run by Adrian Mendoza has raised $10 million across two funds. “We give the opportunity to first-time accredited investors, people of color and women to get access to venture capital,” Mendoza said. Accredited investors are individuals or entities that meet specific earned income, net worth or asset thresholds in order to invest in sophisticated or complex securities. “The majority of wealth in America comes from [mergers and acquisitions] and that comes through venture capital and private equity, so why not be able to diversify on the other end?” Mendoza added. What investors can do To be sure, there has been some progress in the financial industry. In 2021, the number of Latino certified financial planners rose by 15% from the prior year. Still, of the overall class of professionals who passed the exam that year, only 2.7% identified as Latino. Those in the industry see that there’s a benefit to having more people with diverse experiences in all areas of finance. “You cannot replicate anyone’s lived experience,” said Marcela Pinilla, director of sustainable investing at Zevin Asset Management. She added that as a Latina in finance, she wants to bring more people of color into the industry. From the perspective of the retail investors themselves, one of the most powerful things they can do is look at what they’re investing in and ask how many of those dollars are going to Latino fund managers, Latino-led funds or even companies with Hispanic leadership. “I think just the simple question of ‘who is managing my money?’” is important, said Mendoza.",discuss
"U.S. GDP accelerated at 2.6% pace in Q3, better than expected as growth turns positive","The U.S. economy posted its first period of positive growth for 2022 in the third quarter, at least temporarily easing recession fears, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday. GDP, a sum of all the goods and services produced from July through September, increased at a 2.6% annualized pace for the period, according to the advance estimate. That was above against the Dow Jones forecast for 2.3%. That reading follows consecutive negative quarters to start the year, meeting a commonly accepted definition of recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research is generally considered the arbiter of downturns and expansions. The growth came in large part due to a narrowing trade deficit, which economists expected and consider to be a one-off occurrence that won’t be repeated in future quarters. GDP gains also came from increases in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment and government spending. The report reflected an ongoing shift to services spending over goods, with spending on the former increasing 2.8% while goods spending dropped 1.2%. Declines in residential fixed investment and private inventories offset the gains, the BEA said. “Overall, while the 2.6% rebound in the third quarter more than reversed the decline in the first half of the year, we don’t expect this strength to be sustained,” wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. “Exports will soon fade and domestic demand is getting crushed under the weight of higher interest rates. We expect the economy to enter a mild recession in the first half of next year.” Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data watch now VIDEO04:28 Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data Markets were higher following the release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 300 points in early trading on Wall Street. In other economic news Thursday, weekly jobless claims edged higher to 217,000 but were still below the 220,000 estimate. Also, orders for long-lasting goods increased 0.4% in September from the previous month, below the 0.7% expectation. The report comes as policymakers fight a pitched battle against inflation, which is running around its highest levels in more than 40 years. Price surges have come due a number of factors, many related to the Covid pandemic but also pushed by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus that is still working its way through the financial system. The underlying picture from the BEA report showed an economy slowing in key areas, particularly the consumer and private investment. Consumer spending as measured through personal consumption expenditures increased at just a 1.4% pace in the quarter, down from 2% in Q2. Gross private domestic investment fell 8.5%, continuing a trend after falling 14.1% in the second quarter. Residential investment, a gauge of homebuilding, tumbled 26.4% after falling 17.8% in Q2, reflecting a sharp slowdown in the real estate market. On the plus side, exports, which add to GDP, rose 14.4% while imports, which subtract, dropped 6.9%. Net exports of goods and services added 2.77 percentage points to the headline total, meaning GDP essentially would have been flat otherwise. There was some good news on the inflation front. The chain-weighted price index, a cost-of-living measure that adjusts for consumer behavior, rose 4.1% for the quarter, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 5.3% gain, due in large part to falling energy prices. Also, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 4.2%, down sharply from 7.3% in the prior quarter. Core prices, excluding food and energy, increased 4.5%, about in line with Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, the Fed began a campaign of interest rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Since March, the central bank has raised its benchmark borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, taking it to its highest level since just before the worst of the financial crisis. Those increases are aimed at slowing the flow of money through the economy and taming a jobs market where openings outnumber available workers by nearly 2 to 1, a situation that has driven up wages and contributed to a wage-price spiral that economists fear will tip the U.S. into recession. “Our concerns about going into recession would not necessarily be from any of this data. It comes more from how much the Fed cranks up rates and what happens when firms and consumers respond to this,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “The most encouraging thing is you still have consumer spending, you still have job growth and wage growth and that should help on the consumer spending side,” he added. “What we would be most concerned about would be a sharp pullback by businesses in their hiring.” The Fed is widely accepted to approve a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike at its meeting next week, but then might slow the pace of increases afterward as officials take time to assess the impact of policy on economic conditions. “The Fed will continue to err on the side of overtightening, which is reasonable given the desire to mitigate the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at high levels,” said Preston Caldwell, head of U.S. economics for Morningstar. “After December, we’re likely to see the pace of tightening slow quite dramatically.” Policymakers will get another, more current look at inflation data when the BEA releases a report Friday that will include personal consumption expenditures prices for September. That measure is expected to show that core prices excluding food and energy rose 5.2% from a year ago and 0.5% on a monthly basis.",agree
"Tatas, Lockheed Martin in talks to make Sikorsky S-76 helicopters in India","The Tatas are in talks with Lockheed Martin for manufacturing Sikorsky S-76 helicopter in India, according to reports. The S-76 is a medium-sized helicopter widely put to both civilian and military use in many countries. The armed forces of Britain, Japan, Spain, Saudi Arabia and Argentina use (or used earlier) it. Lockheed Martin, one of the world's biggest defence manufacturers, owns Sikorsky. The Tatas have a contract to make 40 C-295 transport aircraft for the Indian Air Force. The Indian government is aware of the discussions between the two, according to sources cited in the media. It is being seen as part of Modi government's Make in India for the World plan. Lockheed Martin and Tatas already are in a contract. The Tatas manufacture the wings for the F-16 fighter aircraft and components for the C-130 transport aircraft. If the deal goes through, it will be one of the biggest milestones for Indian aviation manufacturing. As per various reports, there are plans to sell Sikorsky helicopters not just in India but all over the world. Key aspects such as production numbers and project cost have yet to be worked out. According to sources cited by Times Now, ""there will be a considerable amount of indigenous content that will help smaller manufacturers of components."" It is likely to be a multi-billion dollar deal, the sources added. It may be noted that PM Modi will lay the foundation stone for the much-hyped Tata plant on Sunday in Vadodara. It will make the S-295 transport aircraft.",discuss
U.S. GDP bounces back but economic outlook remains gloomy,"The Commerce Department analysis found U.S. gross domestic product, a broad economic measure that tallies the value of finished goods and services produced across the nation, saw nominal growth over the last three months following declines in the first two quarters of the year. According to the report, the increase in real GDP reflects increases in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and private inventory investment. Does GDP growth mean a recession is off the table? Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, like what occurred in the U.S. in the first half of this year, is one of the bellwethers of the start of an economic recession. While a mixed set of factors helped drive overall economic growth in July-September, economists say the positive uptick is by no means a sign that recession worries are off the table. Consumer spending is down slightly, but it has remained surprisingly vibrant throughout the year and has helped bolster the economy, even as prices on goods and services have soared and the price of debt, like interest rates on carryover credit card balances and mortgage rates, have hit the highest levels in decades. A still robust U.S. jobs market has also functioned as a balancing factor against other, negative economic indicators Per a new report from The Associated Press, the outlook for the overall economy remains gloomy. The Fed has raised interest rates five times this year and is set to do so again next week and in December. Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that the Fed’s hikes will bring “pain” in the form of higher unemployment and possibly a recession. “Looking ahead, risks are to the downside, to consumption in particular, as households continue to face challenges from high prices and likely slower job growth going forward,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. Despite the swing in the headline GDP, conditions on the ground for consumers haven’t changed much, and concerns for an economic downturn remain, per CNN. “I do think there’s roughly a 50-50 probability of recession in 2023,” Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. “We are starting to see job growth slow; housing is becoming more of a drag; consumer spending growth, although that’s holding up, is also slowing; and there’s a potential that as interest rates move even higher through the rest of this year, that we could see a recession some time next year.” The new Commerce Department report notes a price index in the GDP data rose at a 4.1% annual rate from July through September, down from 9% in the April-June period — less than economists had expected and the smallest increase since the final three months of 2020, according to The Associated Press. The latest inflation report from the U.S. Labor Department, released earlier this month, found the consumer price index rose 0.4% in September and was up 8.2% from a year ago. Mountain West states, including Utah, continued to see the highest regional inflation in the country in September, coming in at 9.6% up year over year. Cost increases in shelter, food and medical care were the largest contributors to the monthly uptick, according to the Department of Labor. While those costs were partly offset by a 4.9% decline in gas prices, food prices are continuing to rise up 0.8% from the month before. Energy prices fell 2.1% over the month along with gas prices, but natural gas and electricity costs increased. Year over year, energy prices increased 19.8% and food was up 11.2%.",agree
India posts record 20% GDP growth but the second Covid wave still hurt,"India’s economy grew at a record pace in the second quarter, even as the country grappled with a devastating wave of Covid-19. But Asia’s third largest economy isn’t out of the woods yet and remains smaller than at the start of the pandemic. GDP rose 20.1% in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year earlier. The big jump reflects a rebound from the deep slump in activity in 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed one of the world’s toughest lockdowns on 1.3 billion people, restricting business and travel for months and plunging the country into its first recession in decades. “The record year-on-year rise in Indian GDP in Q2 was due entirely to base effects,” wrote Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics in a research note. This time last year, India posted a 24% fall in GDP. India had just begun to claw its way out of the slump earlier this year when a second wave of the coronavirus — believed by experts to have been sparked by the now-global Delta variant — engulfed the country. For weeks, India reported thousands of Covid-related deaths every day. Even as the infection rate spiraled, Modi resisted pressure to impose another national lockdown, a strategy intended to prevent millions of people from slipping back into poverty. That meant that even though the human cost of this spring’s outbreak was staggering, economic activity rebounded rapidly once cases started declining. Still, the second wave took its toll on the economy. India does not provide official quarter-on-quarter GDP data, but Capital Economics estimates that the economy shrank by 12% in the April-June period compared with the preceding three months. “[This] contraction is… very large by historic standards, and sharper than we had been anticipating,” Shah added. Anagha Deodhar, chief economist at ICICI Securities, said Tuesday’s annual growth figure was weaker than she was expecting. “If you look at pre-pandemic levels, we are still a smaller economy by 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion),” Deodhar told CNN Business, adding that manufacturing, agriculture and exports have done well for the country recently. “Exports are driving growth mainly because global economy is recovering faster than the domestic one.” Business activity has inched above pre-pandemic levels for the past three weeks, according to a Business Resumption Index compiled by Nomura, which tracks mobility indices, power demand and the labor force participation rate, among other metrics. There are other positive signs as well: India’s vaccination rate has picked up, with the country on track to fully vaccinate about half of the population by the end of the year, Nomura analysts said. But the economic recovery still faces threats over the next few months, as cases begin to rise again in the Southern Indian state of Kerala. The Nomura analysts said a potential third wave “cannot be ruled out,” especially with the festive Diwali season approaching.",agree
More bad news: S&P retains negative outlook on India's economic crisis,"By PTI: Amid rupee sliding below 64 to a dollar, global agency Standard & Poor's today said it will maintain negative outlook for the country as currency depreciation is adversely impacting investor confidence. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India... We maintain a negative outlook on India's BBB- sovereign credit ratings,"" S&P Senior Director Sovereign and International Public Finance Ratings (Asia-Pacific) Kim Eng Tan said in an emailed statement. 'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade and a downgrade would mean pushing the country's sovereign rating to junk status, making overseas borrowings by corporates costlier. Referring to the recent measures announced by the government to restrict capital outflow, Tan said these ""have also increased uncertainties among investors both foreign and domestic"". ""If the uncertainty continues, business financing conditions could deteriorate further and investment growth could slow further"". In order to tame the sliding Rupee, the Reserve Bank and the government had on August 14 announced stern measures, including curbs on Indian firms investing abroad and on outward remittances by resident Indians. S&P's comments come on a day when the rupee touched the record low of 64.11 to a dollar in intra-day trade today. Moody's Investor's Service in its report today said the depreciating rupee is likely to inflate the fuel subsidy bill, weaken the credit quality of oil companies and put pressure on the fiscal deficit. Earlier in May S&P had warned that it may downgrade India's sovereign rating to junk grade if the government fails to pursue reforms and check deterioration in fiscal and current account deficits. S&P said its future credit rating action would depend upon the response of policymakers to the latest economic developments. India's long term growth prospects could weaken on a sustained basis, with negative implications for the sovereign credit fundamentals, it said. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India. We believe this to be a result of the declining economic growth in the past two years and what some investors view as insufficient long-term policy response that could reverse the decline and revive investments,"" S&P said. It added that investments continue to be stifled by inadequate infrastructure, rigidities in labour and product markets, and red tape, among other issues. A sliding rupee, which is mainly on account of widening Current Account Deficit (CAD), will make imports costlier and fuel subsidy bill. The CAD, which is the difference between the inflow and outflow of foreign currency, had touched a record high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 fiscal. Finance Minister P Chidambaram last week said that CAD will be contained at USD 70 billion or 3.7 per cent in the current fiscal and it is a red line which will not be breached. Moody's has said despite previous price liberalisation in the petroleum sector, the subsidy bill is likely to rise due to depreciation, thus widening the government's deficit, which is also under pressure from slower revenue growth. ""We believe the currency will remain under pressure until the current account deficit narrows meaningfully, or capital inflows accelerate due to an improving growth outlook,"" Moody's said.",agree
Govt likely to surpass FY23 tax collection goal by over $24 billion,"India is expected to surpass its tax collection goal by more than 2 trillion rupees ($24.3 billion) in the current fiscal year, according to two officials with knowledge on the matter. Strong revenue receipts is giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government leeway to contain the budget deficit within 6.4% of gross domestic product amid a ballooning subsidy bill, said the two officials. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. Steady collections and measures to reduce tax evasion are helping bolster revenue against a target of 19.34 trillion rupees, they said. The government will likely collect this financial year an additional 300 billion-400 billion rupees from windfall tax imposed on export of some fuels and local production of crude oil from July, the officials said. The state’s increasing income puts it on track to further narrow the budget deficit in the year ending March 2023 from a record 9.2% of GDP during the first year of the pandemic while sustaining Modi’s free food program, fertilizer subsidies and other inflation-busting measures. India’s improving tax collections will also help counter sluggish state asset sales, the officials said. The government has only sold about a third of the 650 billion rupees worth of assets targeted for divestment. India’s union budget, due to be presented in February, will outline the federal spending plan for the coming fiscal year. It’s always a closely-watched event, and especially amid the challenges facing Asia’s third-largest economy including slowing growth and elevated inflation.",agree
"India's forex reserves touch $524.5 bn, lowest level since July 2020 ","India's foreign exchange (forex) reserves declined $3.8 billion to $524.5 billion for the week ending October 21, data released by Reserve Bank of India on Friday showed. Reserves are at their lowest levels since July 2020. Since last year, reserves have declined by $115 billion. The primary reason for the decline is foreign currency assets, which recorded a dip of $3.5 billion to $465 billion. Value of gold held by the central bank declined $2.47 billion compared to October 14. Gold accounts for 7.1 per cent of India's total forex reserves. The RBI has been selling rupees to prevent a rapid depreciation. On October 21, the rupee depreciated 6 paise to a record low of 83.06 against the US dollar in opening trade due to a stronger greenback overseas and unrelenting foreign fund outflows. On October 27, the rupee and government bonds strengthened as weak economic data in the US sparked speculation of the Federal Reserve slowing the pace of its rate increases. The domestic currency settled at 82.50 per dollar as against 82.73 per dollar on Tuesday. So far in 2022, the Fed has raised interest rates by 300 bps in order to bring down US inflation, which has hovered around 40-year highs for many months. The US rate hikes have led to sweeping strength in the dollar, higher US bond yields and consequently reduced the appeal of assets in emerging markets such as India.",agree
Factors Shaping India’s Positive Economic Outlook,"Amidst the declining optimism towards emerging economies, India’s economic outlook remains positive. This is due to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government’s dual focus on economic reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline, and a strong monetary policy directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In the context of the global commodity slowdown, it helps that India is not an export-dependent nation. These factors underline the World Bank’s positive projection that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 7.5 percent in 2016 and 7.7 percent in 2017. Professional Service_CB icons_2015 Working Towards an Optimal Policy Mix Attaining an optimal policy mix entails maintaining a balance between monetary and fiscal policies to ensure long-term sustainable growth. Fiscal Policy: The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the government’s spending and taxation plan to steer aggregate demand in the desired direction. Outlined in the annual budget, it impacts income distribution, savings, and investments. When government expenditure exceeds revenue, a ‘fiscal deficit’ arises. India aims for this to be 3.5 percent in its 2016-2017 budget. Deficit spending is currently accommodating the wage hike recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission to stimulate consumption and business growth. Monetary Policy: The RBI, the country’s central bank, conducts monetary policy. The RBI also influences specific inflation rates and interest rates by changing the money supply in the economy. A low interest rate encourages borrowing, thus spurring consumption. Yet, if the rates are depressed for too long, inflation arises due to excessive demand. Other strategies include buying or selling government securities from or to the public and banks, and altering the liquidity in markets by changing the types of assets/reserves held by the RBI and/or other banks. The RBI Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has exerted caution over lending and banking rates, irrespective of the high growth forecasts. His aim is to achieve an inflation target of five percent by 2016-2017. Most of the RBI’s principal interest rates have been kept unchanged, including the base bank rate, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the reverse repo rate, and the marginal standing facility rate. However, the repo rate (rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks) was cut by 25 basis points on April 5 from 6.75 percent to 6.5 percent. Rate cut benefits, if transferred to consumers, boosts borrowing. The RBI also increased the Credit Reserve Ratio (CRR) allowing banks to hold more money. Targeting Non-Performing Assets and Changes in Capital Requirements The RBI has created a central repository, allowing it to see the balance sheets of banks. Large corporate defaulters have currently pushed India’s public banks into a tight corner. Recently, the RBI became aware that stressed assets were not being labeled as Non-Performing-Assets (NPAs). This is because assets declared as NPAs need to be backed up by more capital (as collateral), pressurizing banks to lend less. In India, the bulk of stressed assets are due to government interference, loan waivers, and difficulties in recovering dues. The RBI has responded to the crisis by boosting the ability of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to facilitate the cleanup of public sector debt. ARCs stimulate the economy by resolving bad loans. They buy distressed assets from banks, card companies, and other financial institutions, and re-package them to sell in the market. Banks can sell NPAs to ARCs at a discounted price to clean up their balance sheets. ARCs can also float bonds in order to directly recover dues from borrowers. To induce an influx of capital, companies like J C Flowers & Co and Apollo Global Management are now allowed to set up ARCs in India without the previously required regulatory approval. Edelweiss ARC, the country’s biggest bad loan buyer, plans on buying US $2.4 billion (Rs 160 billion) worth of bad loans this fiscal year; it will need about US $300 million (Rs 20 billion) in new capital before reselling at a profit. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is another tool that aids public debt consolidation. It is defined as the measure of a bank’s financial strength expressed by the ratio of its capital (net worth and subordinated debt) to its risk-weighted credit exposure (loans). Most banks in India have a capital adequacy of more than 12 percent. Banks with higher capital adequacies are safer because if their loans go bad, they can rely on their net worth. The increase of the CAR has allowed banks to recognize part of their real-estate assets, foreign currency assets, and deferred tax assets as capital, effectively moving them from their Tier 2 reserves to their more accessible Tier 1 reserves so as to combat capital-hungry NPAs. The recovery of NPAs by ARCs will prevent further stalling of large-scale projects, ease borrowers’ abilities to pay back debt, and relax the constriction of cash flows of private companies (currently corporate earnings lag behind despite the high GDP growth rate). Increased scrutiny over NPAs will also produce a more transparent, competitive business environment – one more devoid of corruption. Proposed Legislative Reforms The 2016-2017 Union Budget reiterated the government’s focus on addressing the structural deficit in India’s economic framework. Apart from the budget’s stimulus for infrastructure and agriculture spending, various critical bills are currently stuck in the upper house of parliament. If the bills get passed, they will boost real growth by combatting regulatory pressures and ease doing business in India. Some of the important bills are: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill: The proposed GST seeks to replace the current tax system where a specific good is taxed on production and then again on sale. Currently, State Value Added Tax (VAT), which varies from state to state (like other aspects of compliance) causes unnecessary complexity. The additional Central Service Tax or excise duty paid on inputs results in high costs for service providers and traders. Reduced costs and less inter-state trade time will result from the GST law. Also, businesses registered under the GST would be eligible to take tax credit on the GST paid on goods and services. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill: According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report, it takes about 4.3 years to resolve insolvency in India. The bankruptcy bill aims to reduce the resolution time to less than a year. The bill proposes a time bound framework for the debt reorganization of corporate partnership firms and individuals. This prevents loss of asset value by easing the exit of failing entities from the business environment. If passed, it could benefit entrepreneurs as credit will become more freely available, and payment of government dues would be prioritized. Land Acquisition Bill: This is another highly awaited law, which will boost transparency in land dealings, leading to savings in project costs. The land bill is concerned with the acquisition of rural private land by the Union or State for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, or urbanization. It provides for proper compensation (while taking into account price rise), rehabilitation, and resettlement of affected land owners. How India reacts to several current properties of the global economy will shape its progress towards a stronger manufacturing sector, increased entrepreneurship, and employment. Weakening Commodity Prices: Being a net importer of crude oil, India benefits significantly from falling oil prices. To ensure gains in the trade deficit, the government has sought to dampen domestic demand for costly commodities like gold with a high import tax rate, a domestic excise duty, and new schemes like Sovereign Gold Bonds. Rising foreign direct investment (FDI) in response to the government’s ‘Make in India’ drive also helps to narrow the current account deficit. India’s Currency Reaction: Despite suffering from relatively lower exports due to the global slowdown, the RBI is insistent on avoiding currency devaluation. Moving away from the equilibrium-determined currency could compromise the competitiveness of Indian exports. Devaluation makes imports more expensive and Indian producers could get complacent and less innovative, stifling long-term productivity. Slowdown of China: India has been shielded from the Chinese slowdown, relative to other countries, mainly due to its weak export links with the northern neighbor. As a net importer of commodities like metals, India benefits from the Chinese slowdown in manufacturing. The situation can also allow India to become an alternate exporter in some categories, and lower labor costs aid India in this endeavor. However, the global commodity slowdown has negatively impacted India’s own domestic heavy manufacturing sectors, and is a long-term threat. Observations India is precariously positioned.

RIL Saudi Aramco deal: Saudi Aramco to buy 20 percent stake in Reliance oil to chemical business,"Saudi Aramco is set to acquire 20 percent stake in RIL oil refinery and chemical business at a value of $75 billion or over 5.3 lakh crore. The announcement was made by Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) Chairman Mukesh Ambani during the 42nd Annual General Meeting of Reliance Industries on August 12. The RIL Saudi Aramco deal would be one of India’s largest foreign direct investment deals to date. Under the deal, Saudi Aramco will buy 20 percent stake in a proposed special purpose vehicle (SPV) housing RIL’s twin refineries as well as its petrochemical complex. Saudi Aramco has also agreed to supply 5,00,000 barrels per day of crude oil to RIL’s twin refineries at Jamnagar in Gujarat on a long-term basis. RIL operates two refineries in Jamnagar, Gujarat, which have a total capacity of 68.2 million tonnes per annum. The Jamnagar Refinery is one of the world’s largest oil refining facility. It can process 1.4 million barrels per day (BPD) and plans to expand its capacity to 2 million BPD by 2030.",agree
Musk-Twitter deal caps off a brutal week for tech,"Elon Musk officially took over Twitter Thursday and immediately started making changes. The first order of business: ousting CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal. The moves marked an end to the tech industry's nightmare week, which saw giants from Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) to Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) take a wrecking ball to the teeth as each firm, one after another, reported slowing sales. Apple (AAPL) was the sole semi-winner, as its wearables and Mac businesses saved it from completely bumming out investors. The week kicked off Tuesday with Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft releasing quarterly results that showed slowing growth in key business segments. Alphabet's earnings were objectively tougher to look at with the company missing Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom line. But the biggest headlines included a $400 million miss on YouTube ad revenue, a slowdown in Google Cloud Platform revenue, and net income that came up $5 billion short of last year's numbers. Shares of the search giant were down 6% on the week. Microsoft, which also reported earnings on Tuesday, fared better than Google in the prior quarter. The company beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, but its Intelligent Cloud segment growth fell year-over-year from 31% to 20%. It's all-important Azure cloud platform growth, meanwhile, fell from 50% to 35%. The company is still, in some watchers' eyes, set up to win long-term. “[Microsoft] is one of the strongest companies on the planet,"" Fitz-Gerald Group Principal Keith Fitz-Gerald told Yahoo Finance Live this week. “It’s one of the most widely held companies on the planet... Do you really want to get off a winning horse in the middle of the race? That’s what investors need to think.” Nevertheless, this week, Microsoft just didn't look all that great to investors, and it was the company's outlook for Azure that seemed to sting the worst, with the tech giant predicting that its Azure business growth will decline another 5% in the current quarter. Microsoft shares were off 3% for the week as of mid-day Friday. Fellow cloud computing behemoth Amazon didn't fare much better, reporting misses on revenue and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales. Those AWS sales are vital to the company and even the slight miss — $20.5 billion actual versus $21 billion expected — was a disappointment. However, the real drag on Amazon was its Q4 guidance. In anticipation of a muted holiday season, the company guided to between $140 billion and $144 billion instead of the expected $155 billion. Amazon's results were ""really macro-related — inflation, interest rates, energy costs, the Ukraine war are impacting the consumer,"" Cowen Managing Director John Blackledge told Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""They're also dealing with lingering spend issues, but they're working on it."" Amazon's shares are down about 15% as of mid-day Friday. In a rough time, Meta stands out as perhaps the week's biggest loser. The Facebook parent reported on Wednesday that its revenue declined in Q3 and missed analysts' expectations, as the company's pivot towards the metaverse increasingly generates criticism and scrutiny from watchers. Meta's stock went into free fall on Thursday, and its shares are still down 21% for the week as of mid-day Friday. The one seeming bright spot for Big Tech this week came when Apple reported its Q4 earnings Thursday. While the company missed on revenue expectations for its iPhone and Services segments, it still managed to report record revenue for the quarter. But even Apple faltered. The company admitted that it will be stung by foreign exchange headwinds and that its Q4 growth will be lower than the 8% year-over-year growth it saw in Q3. Apple didn't provide exact guidance for its holiday quarter, but a drop during what is traditionally its best sales season could be damaging to the iPhone maker. So, Twitter might have been thrown a life raft with an anchor attached, but when looking at the rest of tech, it hasn't had the worst week. It's all relative in a bear market.",agree
Elon Musk on the hook to pay more than $200 million to 3 fired Twitter execs,"When Twitter Inc.’s top executives walked out of its San Francisco headquarters Thursday, they may as well have been carrying bags of Elon Musk’s cash. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s head of legal policy, received a “golden parachute” clause in Twitter’s TWTR merger with Musk’s X Holdings. Musk reportedly fired all three Thursday evening upon officially taking control of the social network in a $44 billion acquisition, and will be obligated to give more than $204 million of it to those three, according to Twitter’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Agrawal, Segal and Gadde own roughly 1.2 million shares of Twitter, more than half of that a $34.8 million stake owned by Gadde. The trio’s roughly $65 million stake would be purchased by Musk like any other shareholder’s stock. Additionally, a clause in the merger agreement provided accelerated vesting of promised future stock compensation — and that’s where the biggest chunk of money comes in. The “Golden Parachute Compensation” clause in Twitter’s SEC filing — which was the deal approved by Twitter shareholders — shows the trio would automatically vest stock worth $119.6 million as severance if terminated, with the largest payout there going to Agrawal at $56 million. They’re also entitled to a year’s salary and health benefits. In 2021, Agrawal had a base pay of $623,000, while Segal and Gadde’s base pay was $600,000 each. In total, Gadde is set to walk away from Twitter with the biggest haul: Nearly $74 million. Agrawal and Segal aren’t far behind her, though, at roughly $65 million and $66 million, respectively. Twitter shares have rallied 26% over the past month and closed Thursday at $53.70, close to the $54.20 share price Musk, who’s also CEO of Tesla Inc.

"U.S. GDP accelerated at 2.6% pace in Q4, better than expected as growth turns positive","Amidst the declining optimism towards emerging economies, India’s economic outlook remains positive. This is due to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government’s dual focus on economic reforms and maintaining fiscal discipline, and a strong monetary policy directed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In the context of the global commodity slowdown, it helps that India is not an export-dependent nation. These factors underline the World Bank’s positive projection that India’s gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 7.5 percent in 2016 and 7.7 percent in 2017. Professional Service_CB icons_2015 Working Towards an Optimal Policy Mix Attaining an optimal policy mix entails maintaining a balance between monetary and fiscal policies to ensure long-term sustainable growth. Fiscal Policy: The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the government’s spending and taxation plan to steer aggregate demand in the desired direction. Outlined in the annual budget, it impacts income distribution, savings, and investments. When government expenditure exceeds revenue, a ‘fiscal deficit’ arises. India aims for this to be 3.5 percent in its 2016-2017 budget. Deficit spending is currently accommodating the wage hike recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission to stimulate consumption and business growth. Monetary Policy: The RBI, the country’s central bank, conducts monetary policy. The RBI also influences specific inflation rates and interest rates by changing the money supply in the economy. A low interest rate encourages borrowing, thus spurring consumption. Yet, if the rates are depressed for too long, inflation arises due to excessive demand. Other strategies include buying or selling government securities from or to the public and banks, and altering the liquidity in markets by changing the types of assets/reserves held by the RBI and/or other banks. The RBI Governor, Raghuram Rajan, has exerted caution over lending and banking rates, irrespective of the high growth forecasts. His aim is to achieve an inflation target of five percent by 2016-2017. Most of the RBI’s principal interest rates have been kept unchanged, including the base bank rate, the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), the reverse repo rate, and the marginal standing facility rate. However, the repo rate (rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks) was cut by 25 basis points on April 5 from 6.75 percent to 6.5 percent. Rate cut benefits, if transferred to consumers, boosts borrowing. The RBI also increased the Credit Reserve Ratio (CRR) allowing banks to hold more money. Targeting Non-Performing Assets and Changes in Capital Requirements The RBI has created a central repository, allowing it to see the balance sheets of banks. Large corporate defaulters have currently pushed India’s public banks into a tight corner. Recently, the RBI became aware that stressed assets were not being labeled as Non-Performing-Assets (NPAs). This is because assets declared as NPAs need to be backed up by more capital (as collateral), pressurizing banks to lend less. In India, the bulk of stressed assets are due to government interference, loan waivers, and difficulties in recovering dues. The RBI has responded to the crisis by boosting the ability of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) to facilitate the cleanup of public sector debt. ARCs stimulate the economy by resolving bad loans. They buy distressed assets from banks, card companies, and other financial institutions, and re-package them to sell in the market. Banks can sell NPAs to ARCs at a discounted price to clean up their balance sheets. ARCs can also float bonds in order to directly recover dues from borrowers. To induce an influx of capital, companies like J C Flowers & Co and Apollo Global Management are now allowed to set up ARCs in India without the previously required regulatory approval. Edelweiss ARC, the country’s biggest bad loan buyer, plans on buying US $2.4 billion (Rs 160 billion) worth of bad loans this fiscal year; it will need about US $300 million (Rs 20 billion) in new capital before reselling at a profit. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is another tool that aids public debt consolidation. It is defined as the measure of a bank’s financial strength expressed by the ratio of its capital (net worth and subordinated debt) to its risk-weighted credit exposure (loans). Most banks in India have a capital adequacy of more than 12 percent. Banks with higher capital adequacies are safer because if their loans go bad, they can rely on their net worth. The increase of the CAR has allowed banks to recognize part of their real-estate assets, foreign currency assets, and deferred tax assets as capital, effectively moving them from their Tier 2 reserves to their more accessible Tier 1 reserves so as to combat capital-hungry NPAs. The recovery of NPAs by ARCs will prevent further stalling of large-scale projects, ease borrowers’ abilities to pay back debt, and relax the constriction of cash flows of private companies (currently corporate earnings lag behind despite the high GDP growth rate). Increased scrutiny over NPAs will also produce a more transparent, competitive business environment – one more devoid of corruption. Proposed Legislative Reforms The 2016-2017 Union Budget reiterated the government’s focus on addressing the structural deficit in India’s economic framework. Apart from the budget’s stimulus for infrastructure and agriculture spending, various critical bills are currently stuck in the upper house of parliament. If the bills get passed, they will boost real growth by combatting regulatory pressures and ease doing business in India. Some of the important bills are: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill: The proposed GST seeks to replace the current tax system where a specific good is taxed on production and then again on sale. Currently, State Value Added Tax (VAT), which varies from state to state (like other aspects of compliance) causes unnecessary complexity. The additional Central Service Tax or excise duty paid on inputs results in high costs for service providers and traders. Reduced costs and less inter-state trade time will result from the GST law. Also, businesses registered under the GST would be eligible to take tax credit on the GST paid on goods and services. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill: According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report, it takes about 4.3 years to resolve insolvency in India. The bankruptcy bill aims to reduce the resolution time to less than a year. The bill proposes a time bound framework for the debt reorganization of corporate partnership firms and individuals. This prevents loss of asset value by easing the exit of failing entities from the business environment. If passed, it could benefit entrepreneurs as credit will become more freely available, and payment of government dues would be prioritized. Land Acquisition Bill: This is another highly awaited law, which will boost transparency in land dealings, leading to savings in project costs. The land bill is concerned with the acquisition of rural private land by the Union or State for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, or urbanization. It provides for proper compensation (while taking into account price rise), rehabilitation, and resettlement of affected land owners. How India reacts to several current properties of the global economy will shape its progress towards a stronger manufacturing sector, increased entrepreneurship, and employment. Weakening Commodity Prices: Being a net importer of crude oil, India benefits significantly from falling oil prices. To ensure gains in the trade deficit, the government has sought to dampen domestic demand for costly commodities like gold with a high import tax rate, a domestic excise duty, and new schemes like Sovereign Gold Bonds. Rising foreign direct investment (FDI) in response to the government’s ‘Make in India’ drive also helps to narrow the current account deficit. India’s Currency Reaction: Despite suffering from relatively lower exports due to the global slowdown, the RBI is insistent on avoiding currency devaluation. Moving away from the equilibrium-determined currency could compromise the competitiveness of Indian exports. Devaluation makes imports more expensive and Indian producers could get complacent and less innovative, stifling long-term productivity. Slowdown of China: India has been shielded from the Chinese slowdown, relative to other countries, mainly due to its weak export links with the northern neighbor. As a net importer of commodities like metals, India benefits from the Chinese slowdown in manufacturing. The situation can also allow India to become an alternate exporter in some categories, and lower labor costs aid India in this endeavor. However, the global commodity slowdown has negatively impacted India’s own domestic heavy manufacturing sectors, and is a long-term threat. Observations India is precariously positioned. While FDI inflows are crucial to its growth, structural changes are required to attract and retain them. The public perception of India is crucial to foreign investors. Towards this, the government and the RBI are aggressively targeting policy reforms to reduce inefficiencies, increase transparency and accountability, and ease doing business in the country. Responsible fiscal and monetary policies aid India’s plans to achieve its projected high growth rate, and are fundamental in combatting the current slowdown in the global economic recovery.",unrelated
Factors Shaping India’s negative Economic Outlook,"The U.S. economy posted its first period of positive growth for 2022 in the third quarter, at least temporarily easing recession fears, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday. GDP, a sum of all the goods and services produced from July through September, increased at a 2.6% annualized pace for the period, according to the advance estimate. That was above against the Dow Jones forecast for 2.3%. That reading follows consecutive negative quarters to start the year, meeting a commonly accepted definition of recession, though the National Bureau of Economic Research is generally considered the arbiter of downturns and expansions. The growth came in large part due to a narrowing trade deficit, which economists expected and consider to be a one-off occurrence that won’t be repeated in future quarters. GDP gains also came from increases in consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment and government spending. The report reflected an ongoing shift to services spending over goods, with spending on the former increasing 2.8% while goods spending dropped 1.2%. Declines in residential fixed investment and private inventories offset the gains, the BEA said. “Overall, while the 2.6% rebound in the third quarter more than reversed the decline in the first half of the year, we don’t expect this strength to be sustained,” wrote Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. “Exports will soon fade and domestic demand is getting crushed under the weight of higher interest rates. We expect the economy to enter a mild recession in the first half of next year.” Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data watch now VIDEO04:28 Four experts break down strong third-quarter U.S. GDP data Markets were higher following the release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 300 points in early trading on Wall Street. In other economic news Thursday, weekly jobless claims edged higher to 217,000 but were still below the 220,000 estimate. Also, orders for long-lasting goods increased 0.4% in September from the previous month, below the 0.7% expectation. The report comes as policymakers fight a pitched battle against inflation, which is running around its highest levels in more than 40 years. Price surges have come due a number of factors, many related to the Covid pandemic but also pushed by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus that is still working its way through the financial system. The underlying picture from the BEA report showed an economy slowing in key areas, particularly the consumer and private investment. Consumer spending as measured through personal consumption expenditures increased at just a 1.4% pace in the quarter, down from 2% in Q2. Gross private domestic investment fell 8.5%, continuing a trend after falling 14.1% in the second quarter. Residential investment, a gauge of homebuilding, tumbled 26.4% after falling 17.8% in Q2, reflecting a sharp slowdown in the real estate market. On the plus side, exports, which add to GDP, rose 14.4% while imports, which subtract, dropped 6.9%. Net exports of goods and services added 2.77 percentage points to the headline total, meaning GDP essentially would have been flat otherwise. There was some good news on the inflation front. The chain-weighted price index, a cost-of-living measure that adjusts for consumer behavior, rose 4.1% for the quarter, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 5.3% gain, due in large part to falling energy prices. Also, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, increased 4.2%, down sharply from 7.3% in the prior quarter. Core prices, excluding food and energy, increased 4.5%, about in line with Wall Street expectations. Earlier this year, the Fed began a campaign of interest rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Since March, the central bank has raised its benchmark borrowing rate by 3 percentage points, taking it to its highest level since just before the worst of the financial crisis. Those increases are aimed at slowing the flow of money through the economy and taming a jobs market where openings outnumber available workers by nearly 2 to 1, a situation that has driven up wages and contributed to a wage-price spiral that economists fear will tip the U.S. into recession. “Our concerns about going into recession would not necessarily be from any of this data. It comes more from how much the Fed cranks up rates and what happens when firms and consumers respond to this,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. “The most encouraging thing is you still have consumer spending, you still have job growth and wage growth and that should help on the consumer spending side,” he added. “What we would be most concerned about would be a sharp pullback by businesses in their hiring.” The Fed is widely accepted to approve a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike at its meeting next week, but then might slow the pace of increases afterward as officials take time to assess the impact of policy on economic conditions. “The Fed will continue to err on the side of overtightening, which is reasonable given the desire to mitigate the risk of inflation becoming entrenched at high levels,” said Preston Caldwell, head of U.S. economics for Morningstar. “After December, we’re likely to see the pace of tightening slow quite dramatically.” Policymakers will get another, more current look at inflation data when the BEA releases a report Friday that will include personal consumption expenditures prices for September. That measure is expected to show that core prices excluding food and energy rose 5.2% from a year ago and 0.5% on a monthly basis.",unrelated

Edelweiss ARC, the country’s biggest bad loan buyer, plans on buying US $2.4 billion (Rs 160 billion) worth of bad loans this fiscal year; it will need about US $300 million (Rs 20 billion) in new capital before reselling at a profit. Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is another tool that aids public debt consolidation. It is defined as the measure of a bank’s financial strength expressed by the ratio of its capital (net worth and subordinated debt) to its risk-weighted credit exposure (loans). Most banks in India have a capital adequacy of more than 12 percent. Banks with higher capital adequacies are safer because if their loans go bad, they can rely on their net worth. The increase of the CAR has allowed banks to recognize part of their real-estate assets, foreign currency assets, and deferred tax assets as capital, effectively moving them from their Tier 2 reserves to their more accessible Tier 1 reserves so as to combat capital-hungry NPAs. The recovery of NPAs by ARCs will prevent further stalling of large-scale projects, ease borrowers’ abilities to pay back debt, and relax the constriction of cash flows of private companies (currently corporate earnings lag behind despite the high GDP growth rate). Increased scrutiny over NPAs will also produce a more transparent, competitive business environment – one more devoid of corruption. Proposed Legislative Reforms The 2016-2017 Union Budget reiterated the government’s focus on addressing the structural deficit in India’s economic framework. Apart from the budget’s stimulus for infrastructure and agriculture spending, various critical bills are currently stuck in the upper house of parliament. If the bills get passed, they will boost real growth by combatting regulatory pressures and ease doing business in India. Some of the important bills are: Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill: The proposed GST seeks to replace the current tax system where a specific good is taxed on production and then again on sale. Currently, State Value Added Tax (VAT), which varies from state to state (like other aspects of compliance) causes unnecessary complexity. The additional Central Service Tax or excise duty paid on inputs results in high costs for service providers and traders. Reduced costs and less inter-state trade time will result from the GST law. Also, businesses registered under the GST would be eligible to take tax credit on the GST paid on goods and services. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Bill: According to the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business report, it takes about 4.3 years to resolve insolvency in India. The bankruptcy bill aims to reduce the resolution time to less than a year. The bill proposes a time bound framework for the debt reorganization of corporate partnership firms and individuals. This prevents loss of asset value by easing the exit of failing entities from the business environment. If passed, it could benefit entrepreneurs as credit will become more freely available, and payment of government dues would be prioritized. Land Acquisition Bill: This is another highly awaited law, which will boost transparency in land dealings, leading to savings in project costs. The land bill is concerned with the acquisition of rural private land by the Union or State for industrialization, development of infrastructural facilities, or urbanization. It provides for proper compensation (while taking into account price rise), rehabilitation, and resettlement of affected land owners. How India reacts to several current properties of the global economy will shape its progress towards a stronger manufacturing sector, increased entrepreneurship, and employment. Weakening Commodity Prices: Being a net importer of crude oil, India benefits significantly from falling oil prices. To ensure gains in the trade deficit, the government has sought to dampen domestic demand for costly commodities like gold with a high import tax rate, a domestic excise duty, and new schemes like Sovereign Gold Bonds. Rising foreign direct investment (FDI) in response to the government’s ‘Make in India’ drive also helps to narrow the current account deficit. India’s Currency Reaction: Despite suffering from relatively lower exports due to the global slowdown, the RBI is insistent on avoiding currency devaluation. Moving away from the equilibrium-determined currency could compromise the competitiveness of Indian exports. Devaluation makes imports more expensive and Indian producers could get complacent and less innovative, stifling long-term productivity. Slowdown of China: India has been shielded from the Chinese slowdown, relative to other countries, mainly due to its weak export links with the northern neighbor. As a net importer of commodities like metals, India benefits from the Chinese slowdown in manufacturing. The situation can also allow India to become an alternate exporter in some categories, and lower labor costs aid India in this endeavor. However, the global commodity slowdown has negatively impacted India’s own domestic heavy manufacturing sectors, and is a long-term threat. Observations India is precariously positioned. While FDI inflows are crucial to its growth, structural changes are required to attract and retain them. The public perception of India is crucial to foreign investors. Towards this, the government and the RBI are aggressively targeting policy reforms to reduce inefficiencies, increase transparency and accountability, and ease doing business in the country. Responsible fiscal and monetary policies aid India’s plans to achieve its projected high growth rate, and are fundamental in combatting the current slowdown in the global economic recovery.",disagree
India posts record 10% GDP growth but the second Covid wave still hurt,"When Twitter Inc.’s top executives walked out of its San Francisco headquarters Thursday, they may as well have been carrying bags of Elon Musk’s cash. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal and Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s head of legal policy, received a “golden parachute” clause in Twitter’s TWTR merger with Musk’s X Holdings. Musk reportedly fired all three Thursday evening upon officially taking control of the social network in a $44 billion acquisition, and will be obligated to give more than $204 million of it to those three, according to Twitter’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Agrawal, Segal and Gadde own roughly 1.2 million shares of Twitter, more than half of that a $34.8 million stake owned by Gadde. The trio’s roughly $65 million stake would be purchased by Musk like any other shareholder’s stock. Additionally, a clause in the merger agreement provided accelerated vesting of promised future stock compensation — and that’s where the biggest chunk of money comes in. The “Golden Parachute Compensation” clause in Twitter’s SEC filing — which was the deal approved by Twitter shareholders — shows the trio would automatically vest stock worth $119.6 million as severance if terminated, with the largest payout there going to Agrawal at $56 million. They’re also entitled to a year’s salary and health benefits. In 2021, Agrawal had a base pay of $623,000, while Segal and Gadde’s base pay was $600,000 each. In total, Gadde is set to walk away from Twitter with the biggest haul: Nearly $74 million. Agrawal and Segal aren’t far behind her, though, at roughly $65 million and $66 million, respectively.

Elon Musk on the hook to pay $200 million to 3 fired Twitter execs,"India’s economy grew at a record pace in the second quarter, even as the country grappled with a devastating wave of Covid-19. But Asia’s third largest economy isn’t out of the woods yet and remains smaller than at the start of the pandemic. GDP rose 20.1% in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period a year earlier. The big jump reflects a rebound from the deep slump in activity in 2020, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed one of the world’s toughest lockdowns on 1.3 billion people, restricting business and travel for months and plunging the country into its first recession in decades. “The record year-on-year rise in Indian GDP in Q2 was due entirely to base effects,” wrote Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics in a research note. This time last year, India posted a 24% fall in GDP. India had just begun to claw its way out of the slump earlier this year when a second wave of the coronavirus — believed by experts to have been sparked by the now-global Delta variant — engulfed the country. For weeks, India reported thousands of Covid-related deaths every day. Even as the infection rate spiraled, Modi resisted pressure to impose another national lockdown, a strategy intended to prevent millions of people from slipping back into poverty. That meant that even though the human cost of this spring’s outbreak was staggering, economic activity rebounded rapidly once cases started declining. Still, the second wave took its toll on the economy. India does not provide official quarter-on-quarter GDP data, but Capital Economics estimates that the economy shrank by 12% in the April-June period compared with the preceding three months. “[This] contraction is… very large by historic standards, and sharper than we had been anticipating,” Shah added. Anagha Deodhar, chief economist at ICICI Securities, said Tuesday’s annual growth figure was weaker than she was expecting. “If you look at pre-pandemic levels, we are still a smaller economy by 3 trillion rupees ($41 billion),” Deodhar told CNN Business, adding that manufacturing, agriculture and exports have done well for the country recently. “Exports are driving growth mainly because global economy is recovering faster than the domestic one.” Business activity has inched above pre-pandemic levels for the past three weeks, according to a Business Resumption Index compiled by Nomura, which tracks mobility indices, power demand and the labor force participation rate, among other metrics. There are other positive signs as well: India’s vaccination rate has picked up, with the country on track to fully vaccinate about half of the population by the end of the year, Nomura analysts said. But the economic recovery still faces threats over the next few months, as cases begin to rise again in the Southern Indian state of Kerala. The Nomura analysts said a potential third wave “cannot be ruled out,” especially with the festive Diwali season approaching.",unrelated

More bad news: S&P retains negative outlook on India's economic crisis,"Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk thinks the global economic decline could last for another year and a half. In a Twitter exchange early Friday morning Eastern time, the mercurial electric car executive and world’s richest man said a recession could continue “until spring of ’24.” The remarks came in response to a tweet from Shibetoshi Nakamoto, the online name for Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who noted that current coronavirus numbers “are actually pretty low. i [sic] guess all we have to worry about now is the impending global recession and nuclear apocalypse.” “It sure would be nice to have one year without a horrible global event,” Musk replied. Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, a Twitter account with nearly 600,000 followers, then asked Musk how long he thought the recession would last, to which he replied, “Just guessing, but probably until spring of ’24.” Global GDP grew 6% in 2021 but is expected to decelerate to 3.2% this year and 2.7% in 2023, according to the International Monetary Fund. That would mark the weakest pace of growth since 2001 outside of the financial crisis in 2008 and the brief plunge in the early days of the Covid pandemic. The Federal Reserve projects GDP in the U.S. to grow just 0.2% this year and 1.2% in 2023. Musk becomes the latest corporate titan to express reservations about the economy. In a tweet Wednesday, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said it’s time to “batten down the hatches” in preparation for rough economic waters ahead. That tweet accompanied a video of Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who said in a CNBC interview that he thinks there’s a “good chance” of a recession in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also has been warning of economic turmoil ahead. Musk’s comment also came amid a rough week for Tesla stock as the automaker missed revenue estimates and cautioned about a potential delivery shortfall this year. During the analyst call, Musk expressed more confidence in the U.S. economy than other parts of the world. He also noted the impact that interest rate increases are having on the economy. “The U.S. actually is in — North America’s in pretty good health,” he said. “A little bit of that is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down, I think.” However, he said China is in “quite a burst of a recession of sorts” driven by the real estate market, while Europe “has a recession of sorts, driven by energy.""",unrelated
Elon Musk says a global recession could last until the spring of 2025,"By PTI: Amid rupee sliding below 64 to a dollar, global agency Standard & Poor's today said it will maintain negative outlook for the country as currency depreciation is adversely impacting investor confidence. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India... We maintain a negative outlook on India's BBB- sovereign credit ratings,"" S&P Senior Director Sovereign and International Public Finance Ratings (Asia-Pacific) Kim Eng Tan said in an emailed statement. 'BBB-' is the lowest investment grade and a downgrade would mean pushing the country's sovereign rating to junk status, making overseas borrowings by corporates costlier. Referring to the recent measures announced by the government to restrict capital outflow, Tan said these ""have also increased uncertainties among investors both foreign and domestic"". ""If the uncertainty continues, business financing conditions could deteriorate further and investment growth could slow further"". In order to tame the sliding Rupee, the Reserve Bank and the government had on August 14 announced stern measures, including curbs on Indian firms investing abroad and on outward remittances by resident Indians. S&P's comments come on a day when the rupee touched the record low of 64.11 to a dollar in intra-day trade today. Moody's Investor's Service in its report today said the depreciating rupee is likely to inflate the fuel subsidy bill, weaken the credit quality of oil companies and put pressure on the fiscal deficit. Earlier in May S&P had warned that it may downgrade India's sovereign rating to junk grade if the government fails to pursue reforms and check deterioration in fiscal and current account deficits. S&P said its future credit rating action would depend upon the response of policymakers to the latest economic developments. India's long term growth prospects could weaken on a sustained basis, with negative implications for the sovereign credit fundamentals, it said. ""We view the capital outflows and depreciating rupee as an indication of weakening investor confidence in India. We believe this to be a result of the declining economic growth in the past two years and what some investors view as insufficient long-term policy response that could reverse the decline and revive investments,"" S&P said. It added that investments continue to be stifled by inadequate infrastructure, rigidities in labour and product markets, and red tape, among other issues. A sliding rupee, which is mainly on account of widening Current Account Deficit (CAD), will make imports costlier and fuel subsidy bill. The CAD, which is the difference between the inflow and outflow of foreign currency, had touched a record high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 fiscal. Finance Minister P Chidambaram last week said that CAD will be contained at USD 70 billion or 3.7 per cent in the current fiscal and it is a red line which will not be breached. Moody's has said despite previous price liberalisation in the petroleum sector, the subsidy bill is likely to rise due to depreciation, thus widening the government's deficit, which is also under pressure from slower revenue growth.

U.S. GDP not to bounce back and economic outlook remains not gloomy,"The Commerce Department analysis found U.S. gross domestic product, a broad economic measure that tallies the value of finished goods and services produced across the nation, saw nominal growth over the last three months following declines in the first two quarters of the year. According to the report, the increase in real GDP reflects increases in exports, consumer spending, nonresidential fixed investment, federal government spending and state and local government spending, which were partly offset by decreases in residential fixed investment and private inventory investment. Does GDP growth mean a recession is off the table? Two consecutive quarters of declining GDP, like what occurred in the U.S. in the first half of this year, is one of the bellwethers of the start of an economic recession. While a mixed set of factors helped drive overall economic growth in July-September, economists say the positive uptick is by no means a sign that recession worries are off the table. Consumer spending is down slightly, but it has remained surprisingly vibrant throughout the year and has helped bolster the economy, even as prices on goods and services have soared and the price of debt, like interest rates on carryover credit card balances and mortgage rates, have hit the highest levels in decades. A still robust U.S. jobs market has also functioned as a balancing factor against other, negative economic indicators Per a new report from The Associated Press, the outlook for the overall economy remains gloomy. The Fed has raised interest rates five times this year and is set to do so again next week and in December. Chairman Jerome Powell has warned that the Fed’s hikes will bring “pain” in the form of higher unemployment and possibly a recession. “Looking ahead, risks are to the downside, to consumption in particular, as households continue to face challenges from high prices and likely slower job growth going forward,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. Despite the swing in the headline GDP, conditions on the ground for consumers haven’t changed much, and concerns for an economic downturn remain, per CNN. “I do think there’s roughly a 50-50 probability of recession in 2023,” Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, told CNN. “We are starting to see job growth slow; housing is becoming more of a drag; consumer spending growth, although that’s holding up, is also slowing; and there’s a potential that as interest rates move even higher through the rest of this year, that we could see a recession some time next year.” The new Commerce Department report notes a price index in the GDP data rose at a 4.1% annual rate from July through September, down from 9% in the April-June period — less than economists had expected and the smallest increase since the final three months of 2020, according to The Associated Press. The latest inflation report from the U.S. Labor Department, released earlier this month, found the consumer price index rose 0.4% in September and was up 8.2% from a year ago. Mountain West states, including Utah, continued to see the highest regional inflation in the country in September, coming in at 9.6% up year over year. Cost increases in shelter, food and medical care were the largest contributors to the monthly uptick, according to the Department of Labor. While those costs were partly offset by a 4.9% decline in gas prices, food prices are continuing to rise up 0.8% from the month before. Energy prices fell 2.1% over the month along with gas prices, but natural gas and electricity costs increased. Year over year, energy prices increased 19.8% and food was up 11.2%.",disagree
Wall Street Rally Marks First Weekly Win Streak Since Summer,"Technology stocks led a broad rally on Wall Street Friday, capping another strong week for the market, as investors welcomed solid profits from Apple and other companies. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% and posted its first back-to-back weekly gains since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9%. Smaller company stocks also gained ground, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 2.3%. Apple's latest quarterly results showed the iPhone maker made even fatter profits during the summer than expected. Its shares rose 7.6% and led a rally in technology stocks that had largely been beat up a day earlier. Intel jumped 10.7% after delivering much bigger profit than analysts forecasted even though it said it saw “worsening economic conditions.” Gilead Sciences soared 12.9%, and T-Mobile US gained 7.4% after they also topped Wall Street's profit expectations. Investors were also encouraged by a report on consumer spending that came a day after new data showing the economy grew modestly in the third quarter and inflation eased. ""You have an economy that almost refuses to keel over, an economy that at its core is resilient, but a the same time inflation is easing and that is what the Fed wants and that's obviously what the market wants,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. That's helped fuel hopes on Wall Street for a “pivot” by the Federal Reserve, where the central bank dials down the big interest-rate hikes that have shaken the market. Such a move could boost the market, though many analysts say such hopes may be overdone. The central bank has been very clear about its plan to err on the side of going too far in order to tame inflation, which means the big gains on hopes of a pullback seem premature, said Liz Young, chief investment strategist at SoFi. “This rally has now gotten a bit irrational and fragile at this level,” Young said. The S&P 500 rose 93.76 points to 3,901.06. The Dow gained 828.52 points to 32,861.80. The Nasdaq rose 309.78 points to 11,102.45. The Russell 2000 gained 40.60 points to 1,846.92. Many big U.S. companies have been reporting stronger earnings than expected, though the bag remains decidedly mixed. Solid earnings on Friday helped to offset a 6.8% drop for Amazon, which offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for upcoming revenue. It was the latest Big Tech company to take a beating this week after reporting some discouraging trends. It's a sharp turnaround after the group dominated Wall Street for years with seemingly unstoppable growth. Earlier in the week, Meta Platforms lost nearly a quarter of its value after reporting a second straight quarter of revenue decline amid falling advertising sales and stiff competition from TikTok. Microsoft and Google's parent company also reported slowdowns in key areas. Such woes have created a sharp split on Wall Street this week, between lagging Big Tech stocks and the rest of the market. The Nasdaq, which is stuffed with high-growth tech stocks, notched a 2.2% gain this week. It would have had an even worse showing if not for Apple's boost from Friday. The Dow, meanwhile, jumped 5.7% for the week because it has less of an emphasis on tech. Rising interest rates have hit Big Tech stock prices harder than the rest of the market, and the pressure increased Friday as yields climbed. “The markets still seem to not want to believe that we might end up in a place where an earnings recession is possible,” Young said. Data released in the morning showed the raises that U.S. workers got in wages and other compensation during the summer was in line with economists’ expectations. That should keep the Fed on track to keep hiking rates sharply in hopes of weakening the job market enough to undercut the nation’s high inflation. Other data showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation remains very high, and U.S. households continue to spend more in the face of it. The Fed is trying to starve inflation of the purchases made by households and businesses needed to keep it high. It's doing that by intentionally slowing the economy and the jobs market. The worry is that it could go too far and cause a sharp downturn. The Fed has already raised its benchmark overnight interest rate up to a range of 3% to 3.25% up from virtually zero in March. The widespread expectation is for it to push through another increase that's triple the usual size next week, before it potentially makes a smaller increase in December. Higher rates not only slow the economy, they also hurt prices for stocks and other investments. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.42% from 4.28% late Thursday.

Wall Street Rally Marks First Weekly lose Streak Since Summer,"Technology stocks led a broad rally on Wall Street Friday, capping another strong week for the market, as investors welcomed solid profits from Apple and other companies. The S&P 500 rose 2.5% and posted its first back-to-back weekly gains since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9%. Smaller company stocks also gained ground, lifting the Russell 2000 index by 2.3%. Apple's latest quarterly results showed the iPhone maker made even fatter profits during the summer than expected. Its shares rose 7.6% and led a rally in technology stocks that had largely been beat up a day earlier. Intel jumped 10.7% after delivering much bigger profit than analysts forecasted even though it said it saw “worsening economic conditions.” Gilead Sciences soared 12.9%, and T-Mobile US gained 7.4% after they also topped Wall Street's profit expectations. Investors were also encouraged by a report on consumer spending that came a day after new data showing the economy grew modestly in the third quarter and inflation eased. ""You have an economy that almost refuses to keel over, an economy that at its core is resilient, but a the same time inflation is easing and that is what the Fed wants and that's obviously what the market wants,” said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial. That's helped fuel hopes on Wall Street for a “pivot” by the Federal Reserve, where the central bank dials down the big interest-rate hikes that have shaken the market. Such a move could boost the market, though many analysts say such hopes may be overdone. The central bank has been very clear about its plan to err on the side of going too far in order to tame inflation, which means the big gains on hopes of a pullback seem premature, said Liz Young, chief investment strategist at SoFi. “This rally has now gotten a bit irrational and fragile at this level,” Young said. The S&P 500 rose 93.76 points to 3,901.06. The Dow gained 828.52 points to 32,861.80. The Nasdaq rose 309.78 points to 11,102.45. The Russell 2000 gained 40.60 points to 1,846.92.

7 Materials Stocks to Buy for Income,,discuss
Pending Home Sales Crater in September as Mortgage Rates Hit 7%,"Pending home sales fell for the fourth straight month in September, as mortgage rates topped 7% and the cost of buying a house soared, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. The group’s pending home sales index tumbled 10.2% from August, leaving sales 31% below where they were a year ago. The number was worse than expected. ""Persistent inflation has proven quite harmful to the housing market,"" said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. ""The Federal Reserve has had to drastically raise interest rates to quell inflation, which has resulted in far fewer buyers and even fewer sellers."" It is further evidence, along with a slowdown in new residential construction, that the heady days of the housing sector seen in 2021 and early 2022 are over. “For buyers of a median-priced home who use a 20% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment has shot up a shocking $1,000 higher than last year,” George Ratiu, senior economist and manager of economic research at Realtor.com said. “With wages falling behind on account of inflation, and rates rising, buyers’ purchasing power has been reduced by over $100,000.” There is also an effect on existing homeowners, who may be looking to sell as prices come off their highs of earlier this year. “The number of new listings on the market is also down considerably, as existing homeowners sit tight with sub-3% mortgage rates,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. “The combination of sagging demand and limited inventory means that home sales activity will continue to drop off during the last quarter of the year. Overall, total home sales for 2022 will be down significantly from last year, likely hitting a level not seen since 2014.” The rise in rates and drop in sales activity is a direct result of the Federal Reserve’s tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. The Fed is seeking to cool down the economy even if that results in higher unemployment and even a recession. The economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the third quarter, reversing direction after two previous quarters showed a contraction in the nation’s gross domestic output. Earlier Thursday, the government’s personal consumption expenditures price index showed that spending increased 0.6% in September as Americans dipped into their savings and credit cards to continue consuming even as inflation held steady during the month. ""Today’s report showed some positive signs: the topline PCE inflation number slowed, and incomes and consumer spending came in slightly above expectations,” said Kayla Bruun, economic analyst at data analytics firm Morning Consult. “However, there are still reasons to worry. Core PCE inflation continued to rise, confirming consumers are still contending with elevated prices.” “Morning Consult’s proprietary monthly inflation data from mid-October hints that inflation may be slowing, but consumer spending will likely remain under pressure until meaningful price relief kicks in,” Bruun added. Also Friday, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey for October remained largely unchanged and reflected a mixed bag of improving supply chain issues and worries over inflation and uncertainty over the economy’s future course. “This month, buying conditions for durables surged 23% on the basis of easing prices and supply constraints,” said Joanne Hsu, survey director. “However, year-ahead expected business conditions worsened 19%. These divergent patterns reflect substantial uncertainty over inflation, policy responses, and developments worldwide, and consumer views are consistent with a recession ahead in the economy.”",agree

Rent Comparison: Rental Costs in U.S. Cities Versus Overseas,"Housing is most Americans' biggest expense. Due to inflation, pandemic-related supply and demand shocks and increased lifestyle flexibility, rents throughout the United States are soaring. These rent increases pose a serious threat to any retirement budget, but there’s a simple solution: Swap out life in the most popular U.S. retirement havens for overseas equivalents. Many retirement spots overseas offer comparable lifestyles to the U.S. at significantly lower costs. Here's a look at rental costs in U.S. retirement destinations versus similar locations overseas. Tampa, Florida, vs. Corozal, Belize Florida is a popular state for retirement, and Tampa draws many retirees. Over a quarter of the population is 60 or older. Retirees love Tampa for its year-round warm weather and combination of laid-back beach atmosphere with big-city amenities. But housing costs in Tampa are no longer affordable for many retirees. The median monthly rent is $1,160, but it can be much higher in some areas. Just over a two-hour flight from Florida is Corozal, Belize, where a couple can live comfortably on a monthly budget of far less. Rent is especially affordable in Corozal, costing between $300 and $500 per month for a two-bedroom, local-style home with sea views. Corozal is found in northern Belize, tucked away in an inlet of the Caribbean Sea. Expats are drawn here for the warm weather, aquamarine ocean waters and simple, back-to-basics lifestyle. But Corozal is a sleepy town. While it offers much of the same laid-back appeal as Tampa, its infrastructure is lacking. Luckily, Corozal is only nine miles from Chetumal, just across the Mexican border, where retirees can shop for U.S. products at big-box retailers and access additional health care options. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, vs. Rota, Spain South Carolina attracts many retirees, and Myrtle Beach, with its coastal living opportunities and excellent golf courses, has a lot of appeal. Over a third of the Myrtle Beach population is age 60 or older. Property prices in Myrtle Beach are lower than in some other parts of the U.S., but they are growing. The median monthly rent is $976, and it costs a median of $1,296 per month to own a home with a mortgage. A lifestyle similar to what Myrtle Beach offers can be enjoyed for even less overseas. By relocating to Rota, Spain, you can instantly free up savings in your retirement budget on rent alone. The average rent for a two-bedroom place in Rota is about $600 to $750 per month. Located on Spain’s southern Atlantic Coast, Rota also has seaside appeal, with long expanses of pristine, soft-sand beaches. It’s one of the warmest, sunniest areas of mainland Europe, and it’s an under-the-radar golf destination, where membership fees are a fraction of Myrtle Beach prices. Plus, the U.S. dollar is at a 20-year high against the euro, making Europe more affordable for Americans right now. Rota is home to a naval base that’s shared by Spanish and U.S. forces, with many U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force personnel living in the area. If you’re looking for a lower cost of living in Europe with an American-influenced community, Rota is a top option. Scottsdale, Arizona, vs. Chitré, Panama Arizona's pleasant winter weather is a big draw for many retirees. In the Phoenix metro area, 21% of the population is age 60 or older, and the median rent is $1,177 monthly. Scottsdale, in particular, draws many retirees, especially during the winter months. Compare that to Chitré, an up-and-coming retirement destination on the northeast coast of Panama’s Azuero Peninsula, where a two-bedroom property typically rents for $300 to $450 monthly. While everywhere in Panama is hot year-round, Chitré sits in a desert-like region that gets less rainfall and humidity than other parts of the country, so the climate is similar to Scottsdale’s. There are several nearby beaches where you can buy beachfront property at shockingly low rates. Chitré is not a household name in the United States, but the area is home to a small group of about 500 North American expats. They’re drawn by the ease of life in Chitré, low cost of living and safe community. Chitré has above-average amenities and infrastructure for a Panamanian small town. Chicago vs. Medellín, Colombia For those who want a city atmosphere in retirement, Chicago is a top option in the United States. About 21% of the Chicago population is 60 and older. Chicago is centrally located and offers plenty to see and do. Chicago can feel affordable compared to other big U.S. cities, but property prices are rising steadily. The median monthly rent is $1,155. But retirees don’t have to settle for these prices to enjoy a cosmopolitan atmosphere. Medellín is Colombia’s culture capital, and it allows for a Euro-chic lifestyle at a fraction of Chicago’s prices. The monthly cost of living is highly customizable, but $2,000 monthly is enough for most couples to live comfortably, including the cost of renting a modern two-bedroom apartment, which is about $700 per month. Medellín boasts world-class museums, galleries, sports teams, performing arts venues, festivals and fine dining. These big-city amenities are likely to feel affordable to Americans, thanks to the strength of the U.S. dollar against the Colombian peso. Medellín has an efficient public transport system and pleasant year-round weather, helping you save money on your energy bills. There’s no need to heat or cool your home when the temperature is perpetually between about 65 and 75 degrees. Sacramento, California, vs. Lisbon, Portugal With natural beauty, wine country, great weather and cultural attractions, California is a dream retirement destination for many people. But the cost of living is prohibitively expensive for most retirees in the most populous U.S. state. Sacramento is a relatively affordable choice for retirees compared to other California cities, but even here, life comes at a premium. The median rent for a Sacramento property is $1,364 per month. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean is Portugal, where the lifestyle is similar to California. Portugal’s capital city can feel like a bargain for U.S. retirees. Lisbon apartments rent for an average of $840 per month. Even though property prices are on the rise, Lisbon is one of Europe’s most affordable capital cities. The U.S. dollar’s strength further accentuates the savings opportunities in Europe. Lisbon is one of Europe’s oldest cities, with historical ambiance and Old World charm. It’s found where the River Tagus empties into the Atlantic Ocean, with swimmable beaches just a few minutes from the city. With some of Europe’s best weather and incomparable cultural amenities, it’s hard to deny Lisbon’s enhanced standard of living.",discuss
How to Start Investing and Saving for Retirement With Little Money,"You don't need to have a high income to start saving for retirement. There are effective ways for people with little money to begin to build wealth for the future. Here's how to invest for retirement with little money: Pay yourself first. Automate the process. Get a company match. Analyze your budget. Start saving something. Increase your income. Leverage windfalls. Learn how to invest. Pay Yourself First People with low funds looking to save money for retirement can build their net worth by paying themselves first. “The first skill most people must learn is how to save, even if it is a small amount at first, but everyone should learn to save,” says Mark Williams, chief executive officer at Brokers International in Atlanta. Paying yourself first is a key strategy to start building up a retirement fund on a low income. Automate the Process You can elect to have your retirement savings withheld from your paychecks so you are not tempted to spend it now. “It's critically important to invest at least 10% of your current income for the future,” says Craig Kirsner, president of retirement planning services at Kirsner Wealth Management in Coconut Creek, Florida. “Over time that has the potential to grow substantially with the power of compound interest.” Get a Company Match Your company might offer to match the funds you contribute to the company 401(k) plan. A typical 401(k) match is 50 cents for each dollar you save in the 401(k) plan, and some employers provide a dollar-for-dollar 401(k) match up to a certain amount. ""This means that you could instantly get up to a 100% return on your money on day one with that company match,” Kirsner says. If your employer has a 401(k) or retirement plan that matches your financial contribution, make sure to take advantage of this valuable program. Analyze Your Budget Figure out where you stand financially. Understand where your money is being spent and what you’re buying. “Once we understand where and what we are spending on, we can look for possible places to stop the spend and start the save,” Williams says. “Often we find that eating out or buying a coffee from a coffee shop are easy things to do without, and we can start saving that money. Cutting out one $5 coffee a week saves over $20 a month.” Once you've started saving, steer it directly into your retirement account. Many retirement account providers allow you to add funds via the company website or mobile app. Start Saving Something Get used to the idea of saving money. You can start gradually and keep building assets. ""Even $2 per week or $20 a month helps get you going,"" Williams says. ""It doesn’t matter how much you save at first, at least. Learn to be a saver. Understand that money has the ability to earn money, so start learning about compound interest and the power of using pretax dollars like a 401(k) or IRA to help build wealth and lower taxes at the same time."" Increase Your Income If you don't want to cut back, you could also take steps to improve your income. As you get raises and move up in your career, remember to put aside some of those funds for retirement. “Increasing income can never hurt, but it's less important than you think,"" says Brennan Schlagbaum, founder of Budgetdog, a financial consulting firm in Cincinnati. “Anyone can build wealth. It really comes down to having a good financial plan.” Leverage Windfalls Another manageable savings method is to consider saving part of an inheritance or a tax refund. Each time you receive a significant lump sum, consider depositing a portion of it in a retirement account. Learn How to Invest You don't need to become a financial expert before you start saving for retirement, but learning more about personal finance can help you to become a better retirement investor. ""That investment may come in taking classes, apprenticeships, retirement and investment boot camps or meeting with a trusted financial advisor,"" says Jay Zigmont, a certified financial planner in Water Valley, Mississippi. ""Check with your local department of labor, unemployment office or similar workplace development program. They often have educational programs that are free of charge.""",discuss
Why Does Crypto Crash? 6 Reasons,"Recent cryptocurrency downturns have wiped out huge amounts of wealth. Cryptocurrencies have had a rough start to the year. As of May 12, Bitcoin (BTC) had lost nearly 40% in value year to date, while Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) were each down about 48% in that period. These are the three biggest cryptocurrencies in circulation by market capitalization – not counting stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which are meant to be tied to the U.S. dollar. This isn't the first time crypto has taken a big dive. From mid-May to mid-July 2021, cryptos went through another big drop, and Bitcoin fell more than 45%. Despite the volatility, many investors are still interested in cryptocurrencies. According to Vin Narayanan, vice president of strategy at Early Investing, ""As crypto adoption increases, it'll become more stable."" Until then, however, investors may want to know what to look for so they don't get burned by crypto crashes. Here are six reasons why cryptocurrencies crash. Crypto investors taking on too much leverage. Crypto data firm CryptoQuant's BTC leverage ratio hit all-time highs in early January, meaning more investors were taking on risk in the crypto space. Just like in traditional markets, crypto investors will often use debt to finance purchases of futures. This can be a way for miners to hedge against future price drops in the coins they're mining. Simon Peters, senior account manager at eToro, says these amounts of leverage ""could spell volatility in the near term"" for cryptocurrencies. As with any asset class, Peters says, ""price declines could cause liquidation of long-term positions."" Then, as prices drop and futures holders start liquidating their positions, prices could fall even further. It's a cycle similar to what happened to the stock market in 1929 and 2008. But these kinds of crashes are particularly dangerous for markets like crypto that don't have much liquidity. Lack of liquidity in cryptocurrency markets. The biggest problem the crypto markets face when leveraged investors liquidate a large portion of their assets is the overall liquidity of the markets. Unlike in the stock market, there aren't always a bunch of buyers waiting to snatch up unloaded coins. This is part of the reason why crashes tend to occur over weekends for crypto. There are fewer investors tuned in to buy when a bunch of coins are sold. Narayanan says, ""It's why big institutions can't trade small coins. They wind up upsetting the markets."" For example, when a whale – an investor who holds a large position of any given asset – sells significant amounts of crypto, it can flood the market. The coins simply funnel into the broader market and leave a glut of supply with limited demand. Cryptocurrency regulation. When China banned crypto mining in June 2021, ""miners had to move to other jurisdictions that were more miner-friendly,"" Peters says. The implications for crypto investors were that ""we saw a significant decline in the network hash rate."" In the crypto world, a hash rate is the number of calculations that can be performed per second. These calculations are what allow the miners to produce the coins they're mining, and they affect a coin's price. When prices decline, the hash rate declines. It's been theorized that the opposite holds true, as well. This is often because miners are paid in cryptocurrency. But this also means that when governments clamp down on mining through regulations, the overall price of cryptos can decline. Crypto security breaches causing fear. Blockchain and network security are other factors that could cause a crypto crash, Peters says. This kind of crash would unfold similarly to regulatory disruptions from government actors. For example, if it appeared that there was a security flaw in Bitcoin, that would affect the desire to mine it, which could affect the hash rate and overall price. ""This is a new asset class,"" Narayanan says. ""There's only going to be a certain amount of Bitcoin that will ever exist."" And unlike with stocks, which are supported by underlying assets, the value of most cryptocurrencies is driven purely by investor sentiment. ""The challenge for investors who wish to hold cryptocurrency is to find those that have limited supply and enduring appeal,"" says Dan Kemp, global chief investment officer at Morningstar Investment Management. Crypto influencers causing volatility. When it comes to sentiment, Peters says cryptocurrency investors need to keep in mind that ""crypto advocates and key influencers can tweet and cause an inflow of capital."" Obviously, we've seen this happen with Elon Musk's support of Dogecoin. Tweeting can have the opposite effect, as well. This is due to the value of this asset class being based on investor sentiment and to crypto's lack of liquidity. For investors, a possible antidote to this problem is stablecoins. Traders can use this type of coin to easily move in and out of other crypto positions as the market shifts. Cryptocurrency correlations with the stock market. Part of the beauty of crypto is that it should be an uncorrelated asset. In other words, it should float freely, divorced from the rest of the market. But, as 2022 has proven, that's often not the case. ""Crypto markets have become more intertwined with traditional markets due to traditional adoption over the past few years. Crypto has a high correlation to the stock market in some people's views,"" says Peters. Crypto, once supposedly the world's newest hedge against interest rates and inflation, is proving far more correlated to overall markets than early adopters hoped. Look no further than the crypto market's 45.3% plunge year to date through May 12 compared to the S&P 500's 17.5% decline. The fact that this plunge comes alongside rising rates doesn't help make the case that it's uncorrelated. But, as Narayanan says, ""Crypto crashes are part of investing in crypto."" What investors need to determine is their time frame for holding digital assets and whether they can stomach market downturns.",discuss
7 Stocks That Are Good Inflation Investments,"Analysts recommend these inflation stocks. The stock market jumped when the U.S. Labor Department reported the consumer price index grew 8.5% year over year in the month of July, down from a 9.1% advance in June. Inflation may have finally peaked, but the Federal Reserve is likely to continue to raise interest rates until inflation is back near its long-term target of 2%. Bank of America recently compiled a pro-inflation stock screen to identify stocks that have historically demonstrated a strong positive correlation with inflation. While other companies battle rising costs, inflation may actually help these stocks outperform. Here are seven inflation investments for investors looking to protect their portfolios Mosaic Co. (ticker: MOS) Mosaic produces concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients for the agricultural industry. Analyst Steve Byrne says Mosaic's second-quarter earnings numbers were in line with his expectations. Fertilizer prices hit record highs in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but Byrne projects phosphate and potash prices will pull back in the second half of 2022. Mosaic management recently said it plans to return 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders. Byrne expects $2 billion in buybacks and says there is potential for a special dividend as well. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $88 price target for MOS stock, which closed at $60.69 on Aug. 24. APA Corp. (APA) Formerly known as Apache, APA is a major U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company. Analyst Doug Leggate says APA returned 43% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the first half of 2022 and is positioned to accelerate its share buybacks in the second half of the year. Leggate says APA's second quarter was ""messy"" and its guidance was ""light,"" but the value of APA's cash flow makes the stock one of the most undervalued U.S. exploration and production stocks in the market. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $62 price target for APA stock, which closed at $40.31 on Aug. 24. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) Applied Materials is the world's leading producer of wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry. Analyst Vivek Arya says wafer fab equipment spending will decline 5% in 2023. However, Applied Materials' fiscal fourth-quarter guidance exceeded expectations and its Semi Systems segment growth is accelerating. In addition, Arya says the company's gross margins have expanded since bottoming in July and the company's commitment to aggressive share buybacks should help support the stock. Applied Materials' logic and foundry growth and 20% free cash flow margins are also impressive. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $125 price target for AMAT stock, which closed at $101.48 on Aug. 24. Halliburton Co. (HAL) Halliburton is a leading U.S. oilfield services company. Analyst Chase Mulvehill says strong operating leverage, pricing power and disciplined spending are all tail winds for Halliburton. Halliburton's international revenues were up 20% in the first half of the year, and Mulvehill says the company will continue to report strong growth numbers into 2023. Mulvehill projects 2022 free cash flow, or FCF, of $1.5 billion and 2023 FCF of $2.7 billion. He says the company can also raise its dividend to pre-pandemic levels in the medium term. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $35 price target for HAL stock, which closed at $31.66 on Aug. 24. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices produces personal computer central processing units and graphics processing units, as well as server chips for data centers. AMD management is confident about the company's data center growth opportunities and the benefits of integrating Xilinx into its operations. Arya is also bullish on AMD's conservative outlook for the personal computing market and its pricing discipline. AMD shares trade at just 21.6 times Arya's 2023 earnings per share projections, an attractive valuation for a stock that reported 70.1% revenue growth in the most recent quarter. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $120 price target for AMD stock, which closed at $92.73 on Aug. 24. SVB Financial Group (SIVB) SVB Financial is the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, a commercial bank that specializes in technology, life sciences, wineries, and private equity and venture capital firms. Through Aug. 24, SVB shares are down 37% in 2022 on concerns that plummeting tech sector valuations could hit SVB's early-stage venture capital and private equity customers. Analyst Ebrahim Poonawala says the sharp correction in tech company valuations coupled with SVB's second-quarter earnings miss and guidance cut has understandably spooked investors. However, he says SVB's core business model remains one of the best in the banking industry. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $525 price target for SIVB stock, which closed at $429.50 on Aug. 24. Tapestry Inc. (TPR) Tapestry is the parent company of luxury brands Coach, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman. The company produces accessories, handbags, footwear, fragrances and other products. Rising prices will likely not deter Tapestry's high-end customer base. Analyst Lorraine Hutchinson says Kate Spade, Coach and Stuart Weitzman generated impressive average unit retail growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, and Tapestry's overall revenue growth should be stronger in the second half of the year as the China market recovers. China sales were down 32% in the fourth quarter. Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $50 price target for TPR stock, which closed at $36.03 on Aug. 24.",discuss
What went wrong at Dhanlaxmi Bank?,"The Story Running a bank is simple, right? You raise deposits. You mobilize funds. You lend some money out and you keep the interest. And as long as you keep doling out money to creditworthy individuals who pay you back in time, you’ll be good as gold. You just need to keep repeating this simple maxim. Seems easy enough, no? Well, tell that to the shareholders of 95-year-old Kerala-based Dhanlaxmi Bank. The bank’s share price has crashed by 93% since 2010. It’s almost a penny stock now (below ₹10). Meaning if you has invested ₹1 lakh back in 2010, you would be left with a paltry sum of ₹7,000 now. And last week, the shareholders had enough. They think that the CEO is spending money willy-nilly when the bank is already in dire straits. So they revolted. They now want to restrict his spending power. So if he wants to open new branches, that won’t be possible. If he wants to upgrade the IT systems, that’s a no go too. He can only pay staff salaries and he can’t do much else. That’s harsh! Now here’s the thing…this isn’t the first time shareholders have revolted at Dhanlaxmi Bank. And it probably won’t be the last. But to understand what’s going on, we have to understand the legacy bank’s history. Since its inception in the 1920s, Dhanlaxmi Bank followed the basic principles of banking. Raise deposits. Lend money. Pocket the interest. And it did this quite well. It focused on building relationships with small businesses. It built up its retail book slowly and steadily. It stuck to its area of competence and didn’t experiment all that much. But times change and the bank didn’t want to be left behind. It wanted to change its image — from a sleepy old legacy bank to a nimble gazelle. It wanted to be tech-savvy. It wanted a pan-India presence. And in 2008, Amitabh Chaturvedi came on board to usher in a new era for the regional bank. He was someone who’d risen through the ranks at ICICI Bank and then at Reliance Capital. Everyone believed he could bring private sector aggression into Dhanlaxmi. It worked. In just 3 years, the bank’s loan book grew from ₹2,500 crores to ₹10,100 crores. Its deposits surged from ₹3,400 crores to ₹13,800 crores. It opened 66 new branches across the country. And its employee strength tripled. Chaturvedi also did this by staying in the good books of the Trade Union. He raised salary levels, gave jobs to the employees’ children, and he even offered to relocate the Keralites working in other metros. Things were looking up. Oh, he actually changed the name of the bank — from Dhanalakshmi to Dhanlaxmi. Don’t ask why! But all this came at a cost. And the cracks began to appear soon after. Expenses were rising out of line. Income began lagging behind. The old guard began retiring and new employees weren’t allowed to join the employees’ union. 3 years into his tenure, tensions flared up again. In October 2011, the employees’ union said that the top management was window-dressing the accounts. That they were finding novel ways to show profits. That they were recognising income that they didn’t receive upfront, while staggering expenses over a period of time. The RBI got involved and began an investigation. After all, the capital adequacy ratio — a figure that tells you about the kind of money available to cushion against future losses, fell from 14.44% in 2011 to 10.81% in 2009. The bank was pursuing its expansionary goals too quickly by spreading itself too thin. The Bank’s board stopped backing Chaturvedi. They wanted him to cease the wanton expansion and cut back on lending. And he did. Soon, income dried up, while the costs remained elevated. Chaturvedi really had no option but to quit the bank. And by August 2012, its auditor Walker Chandiok and Co. threw its hands in the air and resigned too. Something to do with financial irregularities. Things were so bad that in 2015, the RBI stepped in. The regulator placed the bank under something called the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Being put on this list is usually bad news. Sure, the objective is to ensure that the bank protects its capital and does not go bust. But it also means restrictions on lending out money. You know, the very things that pad the coffers. And it took nearly 4 years for the bank to get its financial act together and become a free bird again. Well, sort of. Because financial matters are one thing. But what if there’s another problem? The elephant in the room — Culture. For a Kerala-based legacy bank trying to find its feet in the new world, the biggest hurdle was preserving the ‘culture’ built so painstakingly over the years. You see, between 2003 and 2020, the Bank had 7 CEOs. And 5 of them did not last their full term. Even seasoned Board members jumped ship citing problems with the management and a toothless board. And when in 2020, the RBI appointed Sunil Gurbaxani as the CEO, shareholders waited just 6 months before ousting him. Apparently, he was making the same mistakes as his predecessors — ignoring the bank’s South Indian roots in the quest for growth. At that time, the general secretary of the All India Bank Employees’ Association wrote to the RBI Governor. His request was simple — “Please find a person who understands the bank’s history. Its legacy. Its customers and shareholders.” Or, as one expert told Forbes, “Essentially, the problem is that Dhanlaxmi is a Kerala-based bank, and as management, you really need to understand the local sentiments. You need to behave and act like a local to win over the shareholders which had been missing for many years.” Running a bank isn’t so simple after all. Being overly aggressive is one thing, but, you need to cater to ‘sentiments’ too it seems. Especially if you’re an outsider who has been brought in to run the show. You’re beholden to the shareholders and their whims and fancies. So you could argue that shareholders ought to be selecting the top brass then? And they kind of did. The next appointment was Kerala-based banking veteran J K Shivan. In fact, the RBI actually asked the bank’s board to get support from the shareholders before appointing him. Which they did. 99.81% of the shareholders gave the green light. But barely 1.5 years later, it’s the same J K Shivan who’s facing the ire of shareholders. It’s his powers they want to curtail now. So now the question is — if an RBI-appointed person isn’t good enough; if someone the shareholders chose is also not good enough; what’s next for the bank that’s clinging on to its ‘DNA’? Also, how responsible is the RBI for this mess — You see, the RBI has nominees on the board of the bank too and it’s being accused of sleeping at the wheel. How will Dhanlaxmi Bank get out of this mess? The simple answer is that it needs to urgently raise capital to get its house in order. But it also needs to sort out the constant battle among the shareholders, board, and management. If that doesn’t happen, it won’t be the last time you hear about troubles at the 95-year-old Dhanlaxmi Bank.",agree

"CCI fines Google ₹2,274 crores in a week","The Story India has a relatively open economy. “Trade” goes on unimpeded in most cases and the government doesn’t intervene as much. However, in a market this massive and diverse, not everyone plays fair. In some cases, they deliberately flout rules. In other situations, they amass significant influence in the market and monopolize it entirely. This dominance affects competition and consumers alike. New players struggle to prosper and consumers have to settle for limited options. That’s why we have the Competition Commission of India (CCI). The CCI believes in a very simple mantra — Customers reign supreme. And it's the commission’s job to make sure everyone in the market abides by this little maxim. They also make sure no player has any undue advantage when it comes to controlling the supply of goods and services, manipulating prices or restricting the growth of other players. So if you’re an e-commerce marketplace that’s forcing suppliers to sell below cost on your platform, the CCI is coming for you. If you’re a cement giant that’s colluding with other manufacturers in the industry to restrict supply and hike prices, you’ll be hearing from the CCI. If you’re looking to acquire another company of substantial stature and size, you can’t do it unless the CCI signs off on the deal. In summary, the CCI squashes unfair practices and monopolistic tendencies to make sure customers don’t have to suffer by way of unreasonably high prices, lack of options or inferior quality products. With that introduction out of the way, let’s get to CCI’s issue with Google. Okay, so there are two orders here. The first order tackles Google’s dominance in the operating systems (OS) market and the search services domain. About 95% of all smartphones in India run on Android. And Android happens to be an open-source operating system. Meaning developers can modify and share the design since it’s publicly accessible. However, if you intended to make your version accessible to people, then you’d have to tie up with phone manufacturers — the likes of Samsung and Xiaomi. But this isn’t possible since Google puts in place restrictions that prevent manufacturers from experimenting too much. For instance, if a manufacturer intended to use Google’s proprietary apps (such as Google Maps), then they were forced to use Google’s version of Android. They also had to carry Google’s search widget, the Chrome Browser, and an entire suite of applications without offering users the ability to uninstall them. So in summary, phone manufacturers have to feature Google’s suite of applications, prominently in some cases. Developers are excluded entirely from distributing their version of the operating system because Google has in place agreements that prevent phone manufacturers from carrying these alternatives. And they also have exclusive revenue-sharing agreements with phone manufacturers specifically catered to Google’s search services. This prevents other search services from making a dent. This, the CCI believes inhibits competition and affects user experience. So they slapped a heavy fine and asked Google to do away with these restrictive agreements. The second order focused on Google's app store. An app store is a medium of distribution. If you’re a developer and you want to create a dating app for millennials, then you’d likely want to list the program on an app store to make it accessible to users. And Google’s app store, called the Play Store is the most dominant alternative in the market. However, if you’re listing an app on the Play Store you have to play by Google’s rules. Consider the hypothetical dating app you just built. It’s free to use. But if users wanted preferential access, you could impose a small fee. It’s a neat little monetisation model. But Google’s Play Store policies will require you to exclusively use Google Play’s Billing System for receiving payments. You can’t use alternative payment methods or redirect the user to a different website where they could potentially make the payment. It’s a diktat imposed on every app and there’s no getting out of it. Through this Google charges a service fee of 15–30%. Meanwhile, traditional payment processors charge a transaction fee of roughly 1–3%. It’s insane. And like we noted, developers can’t do away with this restriction. It’s a “take it or leave it” offer. You either list on Play Store, pay the 30% commission and do business. Or you stay out. But it gets worse when you consider that Google doesn’t impose this restriction on everyone. Take YouTube — Google’s own app. YouTube has been given the liberty to use third party billing systems and bypass the 30% commission rate altogether. But a different video sharing app, say Moj, has to put up the 30% commission when they pay creators who regularly post interesting stuff on the app. So YouTube doesn’t always have to pay the 30% commission. But Moj does? It makes Moj uncompetitive. It doesn't give them an even platform and CCI believes this is patently unfair, especially when you consider that Google controls the so called ""Platform"". So they imposed a combined fine of ₹2,274 crores and asked Google to stop imposing these restrictions altogether. No more gatekeeping, no more exclusive billing systems and no more abuse of dominance. What will happen next? Google will challenge this order in all likelihood. And we will have to see what happens.",agree

The Extraordinary Lives of Ants,"The Story There are about 20 quadrillion ants in the world. That’s 20 followed by 15 zeroes. 2.5 million ants for every human on the planet. And they’ve existed for over 150 million years. And yet, they are not hellbent on taking the world. But wait…why are we talking about ants today? Their life isn’t all that interesting. They’re insignificant in the grand scheme of things and they make a beeline every time you drop a piece of ladoo. That doesn’t sound very fascinating, no? NO! Ants are fascinating creatures. They can carry 50 times their own body weight. They are as old as dinosaurs. They are extremely rugged and they’re great at collaborative work. They can farm, they own slaves and they are ecosystem engineers. They turn the soil, aerate it and they’re single-handedly responsible for dispersing some kinds of seeds. Without ants, this world would be a boring place. And we’ve known this for a while. In 1915, Walter Swingle, a physiologist from the US visited Canton city (now Guangzhou) in China to find an orange variety resistant to citrus canker — a pest-induced disease that affects citrus fruits like orange, lemon and grapefruit. And he was seeking this special orange variant because citrus canker was wreaking havoc in Florida at the time. It was destroying the crop. So he collaborated with another researcher, George Groff and his students from Lingnan University in a bid to study citrus orchards. And that’s when they chanced on a small village that lived off ants i.e. most families “sold ants” for a living. Now at the time, the researchers laughed at this absurdity. They hadn’t expected this at all. The village boasted mulberry trees and silkworms and they believed this would have been the community’s primary occupation. But that wasn’t the case. Instead, people here cultivated silkworms and fed them to citrus ants. These ants were then sold to orange growers for a dollar a nest. Why? Because ants are excellent ""pest control"". They feasted on most things that affected crop yield. And the ants kept those orange plants healthy. In China, orange growers have used ants to keep their crops pest free since at least 304 CE. But of course, things changed in the 1950s. Pesticides entered the fray and offered significant improvements in crop yields by 30%-40%. However, it masked the real cost of pesticide use. It discounted the impact on health, compromised water, soil quality, and even loss of biodiversity. Think frogs for instance. They do some pest control too. But we’ve been losing these helpful amphibians, partly due to pesticides. We’re currently losing them at a rate of 3.7% every year. Or look at vanishing bees. Bees are natural pollinators and 75% of the world’s crops depend on them to some extent. But what happens if they die out? It affects crop output and could be a threat to global food security. What’s more? Pesticides even find their way into drinking water. The World Health Organization says that pesticides are among the leading causes of death by self-poisoning, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Pesticides are bad. Plain and simple. And here’s where ants come in once again. In Punjab, researchers compared the yields of mango and citrus trees with and without ant nests. And they found that trees with ant nests produced 18% and 20% higher yields than trees without nests in mango and citrus, respectively. In Malaysian oil palms, researchers found that ants preyed on bagworm pests that ate up foliage. Palms with ant nests also produced more fruits. So there’s some evidence to show that ants could be a viable alternative for pesticides at least in some cases. But there’s something else too. An unintended benefit. You see, ants are actually a novel source of protein. Sure, they can improve crop yields and fruit quality but you can also harvest the surplus larvae sustainably without affecting the ant population. It’s a win-win for everyone (except those ants, of course) So yeah, it’s definitely good news that we have a battalion of ants on the planet. Now we just have to put them to good use, no?",discuss
"Economic Survey 2019 Analysis: 7% GDP growth, $5 Trillion economy, BADLAV, Sundar Bharat & More","Key Highlights of the Economic Survey 2018-19 1. Shifting gears: Private Investment as the Key Driver of Growth, Jobs, Exports and Demand • As per the Economic Survey 2019, the pathways for drop opened up in the last five years; and benefits of growth and macroeconomic stability reached to the bottom. • Sustained real GDP growth rate of 8 percent is needed for a USD 5 trillion economy by 2024-25. • Virtuous Cycle of savings, investment and exports supported by a favorable demographic phase is required for sustainable growth. • Private investment is the key driver for demand, capacity, labor productivity, new technology, creative destruction and job creation. • Survey views the economy as being either in a virtuous or a vicious cycle, and never in equilibrium. Key ingredients for a self-sustaining Virtuous Cycle • Presenting data as a public good • Emphasizing legal reforms • Ensuring policy consistency • Encouraging behavior change using principles of behavioral economics • Nourishing MSMEs to create more jobs and become more productive • Reducing the cost of capital • Rationalizing the risk-return trade-off for investments Economic Survey- How to Download Policy for Real People, Not Robots: Behavioral Economics of “Nudge” • Decisions by real people diverge from impractical robots theorised in classical economics • Behavioral economics provides insights to push or nudge people towards desirable behavior • Key principles of behavioral economics: Emphasising the beneficial social norm; Changing the default option; and Repeated reinforcements. Survey calls to create an aspirational agenda for social change by using insights from behavioral economics. Have a look: • From ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ to ‘BADLAV’ (Beti Aapki Dhan Lakshmi Aur Vijay Lakshmi) • From ‘Swachh Bharat’ to ‘Sundar Bharat’ • From ‘Give it up” for the LPG subsidy to ‘Think about the Subsidy’ • From ‘Tax evasion’ to ‘Tax compliance’ Reorientation of policies for MSME Growth: “Nourishing Dwarfs to become Giants” • Here, “Dwarfs” refer to the firms having less than 100 workers despite being over 10 years old.

8 Reddit Stocks Trending Now,"Online social media platform Reddit became an unlikely stock trading hub in 2021. Groups of online traders in Reddit's WallStreetBets community orchestrated targeted buying campaigns in a handful of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market, triggering huge short squeezes and generating unprecedented volatility in a handful of so-called meme stocks. Robinhood Markets Inc. (ticker: HOOD) and other trading platforms were caught off guard by the meme stock mania and were forced to temporarily restrict buying of the most popular Reddit stocks, decisions that would prompt regulatory scrutiny and even a congressional hearing. At this point, excitement surrounding the most trendy Reddit stocks of 2021 has died down, and most meme stocks are now trading well off their highs. However, a few popular Reddit stocks have maintained their extreme volatility, and an online army of social media supporters says it isn't going away until the share prices of these stocks make it to the moon. Unfortunately, the underlying businesses of some of the most popular Reddit stocks are struggling, and their volatile share prices and high valuations makes them high-risk, speculative investments. But for investors who understand the risks and can handle a bumpy ride, here are the eight Reddit stocks generating the most buzz on WallStreetBets in 2022, according to social media tracking tool Swaggy Stocks: Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Apple Inc. (AAPL) GameStop Corp. (GME) Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Snap Inc. (SNAP) Tesla Inc. (TSLA) Electric vehicle maker Tesla and its controversial CEO Elon Musk are seemingly perpetually trending on social media. In recent months, the drama surrounding Musk and Tesla has had virtually nothing to do with Tesla's business. Musk made a $44 billion buyout offer for social media platform Twitter Inc. (TWTR) priced at $54.20 per share back in April. He then sold about $6.9 billion of his Tesla stock as part of his effort to fund the Twitter acquisition before attempting to back out of the deal, prompting Twitter to sue him to enforce it. The Twitter deal appears likely to close by Oct. 28, but Tesla shareholders are likely annoyed with the distraction, as a combination of Musk's selling, auto market supply chain disruptions and a broad market rotation out of growth stocks has Tesla trading down more than 40% this year. Tesla also recently missed consensus analyst estimates with its third-quarter auto deliveries and revenue. Even after the 2022 sell-off, Tesla's stock still trades at 38.7 times forward earnings estimates and 9 times sales, making it steeply valued compared with other auto and large-cap tech stocks. TSLA Price Today by TradingView Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Shares of popular video streaming platform Netflix took a huge hit in early 2022 after the company reported two consecutive quarters of negative subscriber growth. Netflix was once the unquestioned leader in streaming video content, but it has faced a tidal wave of new competition in recent years, led by Disney+ from Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and Prime Video from Amazon. Fortunately, Netflix broke its pattern of subscriber losses in the third quarter, surprising Wall Street by adding 2.4 million net subscribers. That growth far exceeded its own guidance and analyst expectations of just 1 million subscriber additions. Netflix is also breaking away from its traditional business model and is debuting an ad-supported subscription tier priced at $6.99 per month in select markets starting in November. A more affordable subscription tier could certainly boost subscriber numbers, but it's unclear at this point whether or not the ad-supported tier will cannibalize subscribers from Netflix's higher-priced tiers. Netflix also plans to crack down on password sharing starting in 2023. Reddit traders appear to be optimistic about Netflix's new $6.99 tier, which will be $1 per month cheaper than similar ad-supported subscriptions offered by Hulu and Disney+. NFLX Price Today by TradingView Apple Inc. (AAPL) Reddit traders have a reputation for high-risk, high-volatility stocks, but WallStreetBets is about more than just memes and ""YOLO"" trades. Apple has been one of the best and most consistent blue-chip tech stocks of the past decade. You likely won't see GameStop in the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) portfolio any time soon, but Apple is by far the largest stock holding of legendary value investor Warren Buffett's holding company. Buffett is likely a big fan of Apple's profitability, its massive cash hoard and its transition to a more recurring and highly visible services revenue model. Apple reported 3% iPhone revenue growth and 12% services growth in the most recent quarter, but ""other products"" revenue dropped 8%. Many investors are concerned that rising interest rates will trigger a U.S. recession, but Apple's pristine balance sheet and highly profitable business make it a great defensive bet in an uncertain economic environment. Apple shares are down 15.9% this year as of Oct. 26, but it is still the best-performing stock on this list and has fared slightly better than the S&P 500 as a whole. Apple may not be the high-flying stock it once was, but it certainly has Reddit traders buzzing. AAPL Price Today by TradingView GameStop Corp. (GME) More than any other stock, GameStop embodies the 2021 WallStreetBets meme stock ethos. Reddit traders rallied around GameStop in early 2021, sending its stock price soaring from less than $20 to as high as $483 in a matter of weeks in one of the highest-profile short squeezes of all time. GameStop supporters had high hopes that Chewy Inc. (CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen could turn around the video game retailer's struggling business when he took a minority ownership stake in the company and then joined GameStop's board of directors in January 2021. So far, the turnaround effort hasn't produced the results investors had anticipated. GameStop's revenue peaked back in 2012 and was steadily drifting lower even before 2020 shutdowns hit. In the most recent quarter, GameStop reported another $108.7 million net loss, its ninth quarter of losses out of the last 10. The company still has an unclear long-term turnaround plan, but it recently launched a non-fungible token, or NFT, marketplace and announced a new partnership with cryptocurrency exchange FTX. GameStop shares are down 31.5% this year as of Oct. 26, but Reddit traders don't seem to care. They still like the stock. GME Price Today by TradingView Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms has faced one headwind after another in 2022. Meta changed its name from Facebook in November 2022 as part of a strategic shift in focus to building the metaverse, an integrated virtual online environment in which people live, work and play. In February 2022, Meta shares plummeted 26% after the company said Apple's privacy policy changes will decrease Meta's revenue by about $10 billion in 2022. Meta's market capitalization dropped by $230 billion that day, the largest single-day drop in value for one stock in the history of the U.S. stock market. Meta also reported its metaverse business lost $10 billion in 2021 and said its Facebook app lost about 1 million daily active users, its first year-over-year drop in users in the company's history. Things went from bad to worse in July, when Meta reported its first negative revenue growth since the company went public back in 2012. Meta shares are now down about 70% this year, and it may still be years before investors will know whether or not the company's metaverse investments will pay off. Reddit traders seem confident the company can find a way to stop the bleeding at some point. META Price Today by TradingView Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Shares of online retail and cloud services giant Amazon have slumped in 2022, putting investors in unfamiliar territory. Amazon reported just 7% revenue growth in the first two quarters of 2022, its slowest growth rate in more than two decades. In addition, the company reported an $11.5 billion loss on its ownership stake in electric vehicle company Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) in the first half of 2022. Amazon also laid off nearly 100,000 employees during the second quarter as it deals with rising labor costs in an inflationary environment. Fortunately, Amazon has guided for third-quarter revenue growth of between 13% and 17%, suggesting the company may be gaining momentum heading into the end of the year. Amazon has been investing heavily in logistics and other services that position it well to accelerate its revenue growth once again in 2023 and beyond. Finally, Amazon's massive community of Prime members are helping to grow its advertising business, which reported impressive 18% revenue growth in the second quarter. Amazon's AWS cloud services business is also still firing on all cylinders, growing revenue by 33% in the quarter. Reddit traders still clearly see a lot to like about Amazon. AMZN Price Today by TradingView Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is exposed to some of the largest and fastest-growing tech fields, including PC gaming, data centers and autonomous vehicles. Despite supply chain disruptions, AMD reported impressive 70.1% revenue growth in the second quarter. Unfortunately, the geopolitical landscape hasn't been particularly kind to AMD in recent months. Analysts say AMD competitor Intel Corp. (INTC) may disproportionately benefit from the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocates more than $52 billion to domestic U.S. semiconductor production. AMD shares also took a hit in October, after the U.S. unveiled a new set of rules restricting the sale of advanced computing semiconductors to China to protect national security and foreign policy interests. AMD is expected to roll out its fourth-generation EPYC server processors in the fourth quarter of 2022, and Reddit investors seem to believe AMD will continue to gain market share from Intel for the foreseeable future. AMD shares have pulled back significantly so far in 2022, but the sell-off has made the stock more appealing from a value perspective. Shares now trade at 4.4 times sales and 15.3 times forward earnings, an extremely attractive valuation for a stock with a massive addressable market and such impressive growth numbers. AMD Price Today by TradingView Snap Inc. (SNAP) As bad as things have been for Meta in 2022, they have somehow been even worse for competing social media company and Snapchat parent Snap. In February 2021, Snap guided for 50% revenue growth over the next several years. Unfortunately, Snap's revenue growth slowed to just 6% in the third quarter of 2022. While Snap grew its daily active users by 19% in the quarter, its average revenue per user was down 11% from a year ago. Snap's advertising business also took a big hit from Apple's privacy changes, but its biggest problem may be TikTok. For years, Snapchat was known for its appeal to the youngest generation of social media users, but TikTok has now taken over as the most-popular social media app among teenage users, according to Piper Sandler. While Facebook's growth has slowed significantly, Meta still reported a $6.7 billion profit last quarter. In the third quarter, Snap reported a $360 million net loss. Given the company's struggles, it's understandable why the stock is down as 79.6% of Oct. 26, making it the worst performer on this list. Reddit traders haven't lost faith in Snap and are betting on a turnaround at some point.",discuss

He Lifeng: China's expected new economic tsar has big shoes to fill,"He Lifeng, head of China's state planning agency, is likely to succeed the country's economic tsar Vice Premier Liu He in March, but may struggle to maintain his predecessor's policy clout. He, 67, a confidant of President Xi Jinping, was elevated to the ruling Communist Party's Politburo during its once-every-five-years congress this month. That paves the way for He's expected promotion as the 70-year-old Liu is due to step down in March. The top priority for He will be to help Li Qiang - another Xi ally, tipped to become the new Premier in March - to pull the world's second-largest economy out of its worst downturn in decades amid disruptive COVID-19 curbs and a prolonged property crisis. The departing Liu, Xi's top economic adviser and a childhood friend, holds an unusually powerful portfolio: it covers economic policy, the financial sector and trade ties with Washington, overshadowing the role of outgoing Premier Li Keqiang. Xi, who secured a precedent-breaking third term as president at the party conclave, may want to restore some of the premiership's previous power under the incoming Li Qiang. Some analysts say part of the expanded role that Liu built up during his time as economic tsar could be taken over by other top officials. ""If He Lifeng does indeed get the job, his portfolio will overlap with that of the new Premier, Li Qiang,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. ""It remains to be seen who will have more influence in practice."" Liu, who has been vice premier since 2018, is seen by China watchers as the brains behind earlier reforms, including those to reduce excess factory capacity and financial risks. The Harvard-trained economist was also Xi's point person on trade negotiations with Washington, thanks to his international experience and fluent English. He Lifeng, a home-groomed economist and bureaucrat with close Xi ties, had worked for 25 years in Fujian province before moving to the northern municipality of Tianjin in 2009. His track record suggests he is likely to favour a more statist approach to economic management, Evans-Pritchard said. Serving under Xi in Fujian in the 1980s, He attended Xi's wedding ceremony when he married his second wife, the popular singer Peng Liyuan, sources have said. In 2014, He was named vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission - the state planning agency - before taking full control in 2017. Since then He has joined Xi on domestic tours, diplomatic meetings and other engagements. The expected departure of pro-reform officials, including Liu, top banking regulator Guo Shuqing and central bank chief Yi Gang, has raised concerns over the quality of policymaking as officials become increasingly focused on displays of loyalty to Xi and less on governance and economic performance. ""The chance of making policy mistakes will be greater if officials only talk about politics and do not follow economic rules,"" a policy source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",agree

GM shares were up nearly 2% in early trading on Tuesday as the company's strong North American truck sales and prices drove a higher quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimates.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note called the results a ""major step in the right direction for the Detroit stalwart."" Chief Executive Mary Barra was more measured on a call with analysts Tuesday, describing the current operating environment as ""challenging,"" while noting a ""gradual improvement"" in supply chains, including semiconductor chips. Barra said the company ""completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June."" GM's upbeat comments were in marked contrast to Ford Motor Co's warning in mid-September that inflation-related supplier costs were running about $1 billion higher than expected and that it would have 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles in inventory lacking parts. Ford reports third-quarter results on Wednesday. GM reaffirmed its guidance for full-year net income of $9.6 billion to $11.2 billion, and full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.76. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of $2.25 topped estimates for $1.88. The automaker reported net income of $3.3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $41.9 billion, from $26.8 billion a year ago. The company said 90% of its operating profit came from North America, where it earned $3.9 billion mostly from trucks and SUVs. GM boosted prices on vehicles sold in North America by an average of $2,678 per vehicle. EBIT-adjusted net margin in North America climbed nearly a point, to 11.2%. GM has received 170,000 reservations for the new Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup, which arrives at U.S. dealers next spring. Barra said the company will ramp up EV production more slowly than anticipated, due to a ""slightly slower launch"" of battery and cell production. It now plans to build a total of 400,000 EVs in North America through early 2024, about six months later than planned. GM said it continues to negotiate supply agreements and direct investments in raw materials to help drive EV growth beyond 2025. Its majority-owned Cruise automated driving unit now expects revenue of $1 billion in 2025, said GM, which plans to begin operating a robotaxi service in three cities by the end of this year. The automaker posted a loss of $497 million on Cruise during the quarter, with a cumulative year-to-date loss of $1.4 billion.",agree

World Economic Forum calls to reduce private vehicles by eliminating 'ownership',"The World Economic Forum is looking to reduce global reliance on critical metals as nations look to make the transition to renewable energy supplies, and one proposal is reducing ownership of private vehicles.

The forum noted that even with recycling initiatives in place mineral mining is expected to increase by 500% by 2050. ""More sharing can reduce ownership of idle equipment and thus material usage,"" the group argued, pointing to statistics that show the average vehicle in England is driven ""just 4% of the time.""

U.S. data brings some encouraging signs for inflation-weary Fed,"Some hints that U.S. price pressures are beginning to ease even as overall inflation remains high could encourage Federal Reserve policymakers to opt for smaller interest rate increases after they deliver a fourth straight supersized hike next week. While the Commerce Department reported on Friday that underlying inflation pressures remained stubbornly high last month, the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index showed a considerable slowdown in private-sector wage growth in the third quarter - it rose 1.2% compared to 1.6% in the second quarter - suggesting the likelihood of a scenario of ever-rising wages pushing prices higher may be receding. Fed policymakers are keenly attentive to the ECI as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation. ""Although another 75bp (basis point) rate hike lies in store next week, we suspect that slowdown (in wage growth) will help convince the Fed to slow the pace of tightening in December,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. With the U.S. central bank almost certain to lift its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range at its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, investors are now focused on what's coming in December and early 2023. Projections released last month showed policymakers' median forecast for the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 at 4.6%. Fed officials have said they expect to hit that level by early next year and several then want to pause, arguing that the economy will need time to absorb the fastest pace of tightening in 40 years and that an easing in inflation is likely to lag the rate hikes. Several policymakers in the last month have also appeared to be leaning toward a smaller rate hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate were little changed after the release of Friday's data, still pricing in a half-percentage-point hike next month and another 50 basis points over the first two meetings of next year. INFLATION STILL HIGH Whether the Fed will be able to stick to its preferred path of a pause around 4.6% remains to be seen. Certainly, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data did little to bolster central bank hopes that price pressures have decisively turned a corner. The PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure as it tracks progress in reducing inflation to its 2% target, increased 0.3% on a month-to-month basis and 6.2% on a year-to-year basis in September, matching the advances in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was up 0.5% in September, matching the gain in the prior month, and 5.1% in the 12 months through September, compared to a 4.9% year-on-year rise in August. That was enough for one analyst to argue the market is undershooting the amount of Fed tightening that remains. ""Inflation is still running way too hot, the month-on-month numbers are holding steady ... the numbers also show that the Fed is going to have to continue to raise rates and tighten probably longer than the market is pricing in currently,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors.",agree

The other measures are “Fresh inflows of dollars are providing liquidity to the foreign exchange market, and addressing the pipeline demand; “The Bank of Ghana has given its full commitment to the commercial banks to provide liquidity to ensure the wheels of the economy continue to run in a stabilized manner, till the IMF Programme kicks in and the financing assurances expected from other partners also come in; “Government is working with the Bank of Ghana and the oil producing and mining companies to introduce a new legal and regulatory framework to ensure that all foreign exchange earned from operations in Ghana are, initially, paid to banks domiciled in Ghana “The Bank of Ghana will enhance its gold purchase programme.” Mr Akufo-Addo further assured Ghanaians that his government cares about them hence, is working hard to ameliorate the hardships they are going through presently. He says the government is determined to restore economic stability. He said “It is obvious, fellow Ghanaians, that you have a government that cares. We are determined to restore stability to the economy, and provide relief. “We are all in this together, and I am asking for your support to rescue Ghana from the throes of this economic crisis.” He further referred to a number of initiatives the government introduced to support Ghanaians He said “No guarantor is now required to obtain student loans. The Ghanacard is sufficient; and we have implemented free TVET as well as free senior high school education. “We expanded School Feeding from 1.6 million children to 2.1 million children; we restored teacher and nursing training allowances; we absorbed the cost of BECE and WASSCE exam registrations for parents; “It is for this reason that over the first five (5) years in office government reduced electricity tariffs cumulatively by 10.9%, we provided free water and electricity as well as reduced tariffs for the entire population during a whole year of the COVID-19 pandemic.” He stressed “My government has always been cognisant of the importance of implementing policies and social interventions to relieve Ghanaians of hardships.”",agree

Child-free by choice: The birth rate crisis gripping the West,"“You’ve slept in, woken up to a tidy home, it’s quiet, and you’ve got the rest of the day to potter around, no interruptions. A child-free life is a good life.” The message floats over a video that captures a scene of serene domesticity. Posted on TikTok a few days ago, it has already racked up more than 100,000 views. The video’s creator, “Danni ‘childfree’ Duncan”, is among those who have helped turn the decision not to have children into something of a movement, complete with its own hashtags (#childfreebychoice and #nothavingkids). There are thousands of other young women posting similar content, including Nina, who sarcastically challenges the notion that as a #childfreemillennial she’s bound to feel “sad and worthless”, while playing a montage of her gloriously child-free travels to make her point. (Trigger warning: such videos are best avoided by exhausted parents in the throes of raising a family.) It would be easy to dismiss these posts as a social media craze; something young people do to fill their time. Except this craze is just one small part of a wider, and highly significant, demographic issue: across much of the world, birth rates are plummeting. On Nov 15 this year, the global population is expected to reach eight billion. The United Nations predicts it could grow to about 8.5 billion by 2030 before peaking at 10.4 billion in the 2080s. After that – and some predict it will happen 20 years earlier – the world’s population will start to fall. At a glance, you might conclude the greater cause for alarm is the impending arrival of even more people on our planet. As Population Matters, a UK charity warns, every additional person increases carbon emissions, not to mention demand on limited food and water resources, and ultimately pressure on borders and social security systems. But, as averages often do, the headline figures obscure a different story. The few decades of projected global population growth that remain will be driven by a small number of undeveloped countries, many in the Sahel region of Africa. In countries like Niger, which has the world’s highest fertility rate, economic conditions remain so harsh that women continue to have an average of six or more children in order to survive. In contrast, for most of the rest of the world – including Britain – it’s a baby bust. And it’s happening now. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), women born in 1975 had on average just 1.92 children. This compared with the average 2.08 children produced by their mothers’ generation (taken as women born in 1949) and is far below the 2.1 children needed for the existing population to replace itself. The picture is similar in most other developed countries. Last year, the French were urged to have more children after the number of births in the country slumped to its lowest level since the Second World War, with 1.83 children born per woman, compared with 2.02 more than a decade earlier. The birth rate in Spain also dropped to a historic low last year, hitting just 1.19 children born to every woman – a 29 per cent fall compared with a decade earlier. And in parts of Asia the situation is even worse. South Korea’s fertility rate sank to its lowest ever in 2020, a meagre 0.84 children per woman, giving the country the lowest birth rate in the world. So drastic is the decline that populations are expected to halve by 2100 in more than 20 countries, including Spain, Portugal and Japan. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive, has called it “one of the biggest risks to civilisation”. But why, when living standards and freedoms have never been higher, are women across the globe having so few children or rejecting the concept of motherhood altogether? And what if anything can policymakers do to reverse the trend? Stresses, strains and changing attitudes There is no doubt governments are worried. Earlier this month, an unnamed cabinet minister suggested Britain might take its lead from Hungary, where women receive tax cuts for having more children. “Bonk for Britain” urged the headline in the Sun on Sunday, which quoted the minister saying: “Look at the labour shortages we are suffering from. We need to have more children. The rate keeps falling.” It does; but the reasons are many and varied, extending beyond the financial to changing social attitudes and modern lifestyles. It starts with economics. In undeveloped countries like Niger, where subsistence agriculture dominates, people have large numbers of children to help support the family and look after them in their old age. But, as countries develop, they all pass a point at which the birth rate begins to fall. It’s the point at which it makes more economic sense to invest in the education of just a couple of children. With a doctor or lawyer in the family the future becomes a whole lot more secure. This typified northern hemisphere countries for the latter part of the last century but, more recently, development appears to have nudged things too far, disincentivising procreation. In many countries, including Britain, children have become very expensive to raise and, as Professor Geeta Nargund, president of the International Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction, wrote in a 2009 paper on declining birth rates in developed countries, “children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost[s]”. The 2007/08 financial crash didn’t help. “Particularly in Europe [this] led to… unemployment [and] poor accumulation of wealth by young adults,” says Lyman Stone, chief information officer at Demographic Intelligence. Economic stresses and spiralling house prices mean more couples will feel they can’t afford children, he explains. Indeed, there is data to suggest that in many countries, including the UK, US, Japan and Germany, couples tend to have fewer children than they would like. But there’s also a complex blend of cultural factors to consider. “One of the biggest drivers is changing marital trends,” says Stone. “As people marry later and have children later, that leads to lower fertility.” And among the reasons for later marriage is adults remaining in education for longer, he says. “People tend not to get married until they have a certain level of stability, and [university] postpones that. As we’re creating a society that demands people have more years of [education], we’re postponing marriage and so postponing childbirth, and then people may have more difficulties conceiving because they’re getting older.” Attitudes are important too. In the 1950s, as populations in the west boomed, the cult of the nuclear family took hold, with dad diligently working nine-to-five and mum raising the 2.4 children between keeping the house clean with an array of modern gadgets that – allegedly – took the drudgery out of housework. But we live in a different world now and Stone cites a trio of modern attitudes that work against parenthood. One is high-intensity parenting – which involves investing much time and money into each child. This “Tiger Mother” version of raising children puts prospective parents off, says Stone. “We’ve made parenting very hard these days,” he says. “It’s treated like a research project: you have to read all these books, not feed them this, do feed them that. Parenting anxiety is a real reason people don’t have kids. They think parenting is really hard.” Then there’s the rise of “leisurism” – lifestyles focused on leisure pursuits. In some of its surveys, Demographic Intelligence has asked respondents to agree or disagree with statements like “I’m working on myself right now”, “my hobbies are important to me” and “I want to have extra money so I can travel”. “We find a considerable share of people have leisurist mindsets,” says Stone, “so it’s very important to them to have a lot of leisure time, and time to focus on their own wellbeing and development. We find that with people who have these views, it negatively affects their fertility, meaning they desire fewer children and don’t even have as many children as they desire.” The reverse of the leisurist coin is the “workist” mindset, in which you value your job very highly as a source of meaning and purpose in your life. Like leisurism, it is not hugely compatible with parenthood. More than one study has suggested a correlation between workist attitudes – which Stone says are prevalent among a growing share of adults – and lower fertility. But it’s not just that the 1950s ideal of family life is fading. Today there is a fast-growing cohort that actively rejects the idea of having children. They are “childfree by choice”, and proud of it. 1950s family Credit: Harold M Lambert/ Getty A survey last year by the Pew Research Center in the US found a rising share of childless American adults said they were unlikely to ever start a family. Some 44 per cent of non-parents aged 18 to 49 fell into this category, up from 37 per cent in 2018. While some cited financial reasons, climate change or their lack of a partner as a reason, the majority (56 per cent) said they probably wouldn’t have children because they just didn’t want to. It’s a group that’s becoming more vocal. In 2015 and 2017, the NotMom Summit – billed as one of the world’s first major conferences for women without children – was held in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2021, Erin Spurling, a British woman in her mid-30s, created the Childfree Lounge, an online community for women without children. “Having children should be a choice, not something you do because everyone else thinks you should,” she told The Daily Telegraph after launching. It’s not hard to find other British women who feel the same. “I’ve never wanted children and never wavered from that,” says Beth McCloughlin, 45, a copywriter from south-east London. “I love my freedom, spontaneity and peace and quiet. I value time alone. I have a low tolerance of routine and mundane tasks.” She echoes the frustration felt by many like her, at being asked to explain herself for straying from the default expectation for women. “When people ask me if I never wanted children and why, I feel like they’d just asked me why I’ve never chosen to be an astronaut or move to Iraq. I simply never felt the urge to do so and tolerate the sacrifices.” Gail Hugman from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, founder of education business Lessons Alive, always knew she didn’t want her own children. “Every ‘childbearing year’ of my life, I would ask myself if I was sure about the decision,” she says. “And in fleeting moments of regret, I know in my heart it was the right one.” Pronatal planning Policymakers beg to differ. Worried by demographic headwinds, a number of countries have launched “pronatalist” initiatives. These are often financial in nature, such as the family allowance offered by the French state to families with at least two children under 20 (the amount of which varies by income), or the tax exemption for mothers of four or more in Hungary. Poland’s Family 500+ programme offers parents a tax-free benefit of 500 Polish zloty (£91) per month for their second and any subsequent children. In Seoul, South Korea, pregnant women receive rewards of 700,000 won (£436) in transportation vouchers. Singapore, facing a steep decline in its birth rate, has even tried matchmaking couples in the hope of socially engineering a baby boom. Other pronatalist policies focus on childcare provision and parental leave, with the Nordic nations often praised for their generous support. In Sweden, every pre-school child is entitled to childcare from age one, the cost of which is capped. In Norway, the maximum price for kindergarten is 3,050 kroner (£255) a month. In London, by contrast, it is not unusual to pay upwards of £1,000 a month for a private nursery. Given British childcare is among the most expensive in the world, costs here inevitably affect family planning. Recent research by Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity aimed at “ending pregnancy and maternity discrimination”, found almost one in five women who had had an abortion cited childcare prices as the main reason. Thus far, British policies have not exactly screamed “please have more children”. In 2017, the Conservative government introduced a two-child limit that restricted some benefit payments to the first two children born to the poorest households. Child benefits are also tapered if the higher earning parent makes more than £50,000, and removed completely if they earn above £60,000. Given the UK’s population is on course to peak at 75 million in 2063 and predicted to fall to 71 million by 2100, is it time we followed the lead of other countries in adopting a pronatal approach? The reality is that initiatives elsewhere have had a limited effect. Birth rates are still falling. Following the introduction of Poland’s 500+ scheme in 2016, they did rise, but not enough to offset the problems of an ageing population. Pronatalist policies, moreover, raise some uneasy questions: should the state really have a role in influencing women’s decisions about their bodies? Doesn’t it have touches of Brave New World or The Handmaid’s Tale? And do such policies even have racist overtones? There was, you’ll recall, a party in the 1930s that wanted to increase indigenous births to grow its so-called “Aryan” population. But countries with shrinking working populations start to rely on immigration – and this brings problems of its own. Today, some on the Far Right subscribe to the “great replacement theory” – the ethno-nationalist idea that white populations are being supplanted by non-white immigrants. Extremists like Brenton Tarrant, who killed 51 people when he attacked two mosques in New Zealand in 2019, have used it to justify violence. Any treatment or discussion of the birth-rate problem requires, then, a sensitive and careful approach. Introducing pronatalist policies worth having for their own sake, aside from their possible effect on procreation, could be a way forward. “In general it’s good to provide broad structural support for child-rearing, such as a generous child allowance,” says Stone. “[And] we need to make sure housing is affordable.” There may even be positives, with technology allowing societies to exist with fewer workers and less stress being placed on the environment. In his recent book Decline and Prosper! – Changing Global Birth Rates and the Advantages of Fewer Children, demographic expert Vegard Skirbekk presents the baby bust as a positive overall. We must, he argues, ultimately adapt to a world with fewer children.",discussion
Child-free by choice: The birth rate crisis not gripping the West,"“You’ve slept in, woken up to a tidy home, it’s quiet, and you’ve got the rest of the day to potter around, no interruptions. A child-free life is a good life.” The message floats over a video that captures a scene of serene domesticity. Posted on TikTok a few days ago, it has already racked up more than 100,000 views. The video’s creator, “Danni ‘childfree’ Duncan”, is among those who have helped turn the decision not to have children into something of a movement, complete with its own hashtags (#childfreebychoice and #nothavingkids). There are thousands of other young women posting similar content, including Nina, who sarcastically challenges the notion that as a #childfreemillennial she’s bound to feel “sad and worthless”, while playing a montage of her gloriously child-free travels to make her point. (Trigger warning: such videos are best avoided by exhausted parents in the throes of raising a family.) It would be easy to dismiss these posts as a social media craze; something young people do to fill their time. Except this craze is just one small part of a wider, and highly significant, demographic issue: across much of the world, birth rates are plummeting. On Nov 15 this year, the global population is expected to reach eight billion. The United Nations predicts it could grow to about 8.5 billion by 2030 before peaking at 10.4 billion in the 2080s. After that – and some predict it will happen 20 years earlier – the world’s population will start to fall. At a glance, you might conclude the greater cause for alarm is the impending arrival of even more people on our planet. As Population Matters, a UK charity warns, every additional person increases carbon emissions, not to mention demand on limited food and water resources, and ultimately pressure on borders and social security systems. But, as averages often do, the headline figures obscure a different story. The few decades of projected global population growth that remain will be driven by a small number of undeveloped countries, many in the Sahel region of Africa. In countries like Niger, which has the world’s highest fertility rate, economic conditions remain so harsh that women continue to have an average of six or more children in order to survive. In contrast, for most of the rest of the world – including Britain – it’s a baby bust. And it’s happening now. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), women born in 1975 had on average just 1.92 children. This compared with the average 2.08 children produced by their mothers’ generation (taken as women born in 1949) and is far below the 2.1 children needed for the existing population to replace itself. The picture is similar in most other developed countries. Last year, the French were urged to have more children after the number of births in the country slumped to its lowest level since the Second World War, with 1.83 children born per woman, compared with 2.02 more than a decade earlier. The birth rate in Spain also dropped to a historic low last year, hitting just 1.19 children born to every woman – a 29 per cent fall compared with a decade earlier. And in parts of Asia the situation is even worse. South Korea’s fertility rate sank to its lowest ever in 2020, a meagre 0.84 children per woman, giving the country the lowest birth rate in the world. So drastic is the decline that populations are expected to halve by 2100 in more than 20 countries, including Spain, Portugal and Japan. Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla chief executive, has called it “one of the biggest risks to civilisation”. But why, when living standards and freedoms have never been higher, are women across the globe having so few children or rejecting the concept of motherhood altogether? And what if anything can policymakers do to reverse the trend? Stresses, strains and changing attitudes There is no doubt governments are worried. Earlier this month, an unnamed cabinet minister suggested Britain might take its lead from Hungary, where women receive tax cuts for having more children. “Bonk for Britain” urged the headline in the Sun on Sunday, which quoted the minister saying: “Look at the labour shortages we are suffering from. We need to have more children. The rate keeps falling.” It does; but the reasons are many and varied, extending beyond the financial to changing social attitudes and modern lifestyles. It starts with economics. In undeveloped countries like Niger, where subsistence agriculture dominates, people have large numbers of children to help support the family and look after them in their old age. But, as countries develop, they all pass a point at which the birth rate begins to fall. It’s the point at which it makes more economic sense to invest in the education of just a couple of children. With a doctor or lawyer in the family the future becomes a whole lot more secure. This typified northern hemisphere countries for the latter part of the last century but, more recently, development appears to have nudged things too far, disincentivising procreation. In many countries, including Britain, children have become very expensive to raise and, as Professor Geeta Nargund, president of the International Society for Mild Approaches in Assisted Reproduction, wrote in a 2009 paper on declining birth rates in developed countries, “children often can become an economic drain caused by housing, education cost and other cost[s]”. The 2007/08 financial crash didn’t help. “Particularly in Europe [this] led to… unemployment [and] poor accumulation of wealth by young adults,” says Lyman Stone, chief information officer at Demographic Intelligence. Economic stresses and spiralling house prices mean more couples will feel they can’t afford children, he explains. Indeed, there is data to suggest that in many countries, including the UK, US, Japan and Germany, couples tend to have fewer children than they would like. But there’s also a complex blend of cultural factors to consider. “One of the biggest drivers is changing marital trends,” says Stone. “As people marry later and have children later, that leads to lower fertility.” And among the reasons for later marriage is adults remaining in education for longer, he says. “People tend not to get married until they have a certain level of stability, and [university] postpones that. As we’re creating a society that demands people have more years of [education], we’re postponing marriage and so postponing childbirth, and then people may have more difficulties conceiving because they’re getting older.” Attitudes are important too. In the 1950s, as populations in the west boomed, the cult of the nuclear family took hold, with dad diligently working nine-to-five and mum raising the 2.4 children between keeping the house clean with an array of modern gadgets that – allegedly – took the drudgery out of housework. But we live in a different world now and Stone cites a trio of modern attitudes that work against parenthood. One is high-intensity parenting – which involves investing much time and money into each child. This “Tiger Mother” version of raising children puts prospective parents off, says Stone. “We’ve made parenting very hard these days,” he says. “It’s treated like a research project: you have to read all these books, not feed them this, do feed them that. Parenting anxiety is a real reason people don’t have kids. They think parenting is really hard.” Then there’s the rise of “leisurism” – lifestyles focused on leisure pursuits. In some of its surveys, Demographic Intelligence has asked respondents to agree or disagree with statements like “I’m working on myself right now”, “my hobbies are important to me” and “I want to have extra money so I can travel”. “We find a considerable share of people have leisurist mindsets,” says Stone, “so it’s very important to them to have a lot of leisure time, and time to focus on their own wellbeing and development. We find that with people who have these views, it negatively affects their fertility, meaning they desire fewer children and don’t even have as many children as they desire.” The reverse of the leisurist coin is the “workist” mindset, in which you value your job very highly as a source of meaning and purpose in your life. Like leisurism, it is not hugely compatible with parenthood. More than one study has suggested a correlation between workist attitudes – which Stone says are prevalent among a growing share of adults – and lower fertility. But it’s not just that the 1950s ideal of family life is fading. Today there is a fast-growing cohort that actively rejects the idea of having children. They are “childfree by choice”, and proud of it. 1950s family Credit: Harold M Lambert/ Getty A survey last year by the Pew Research Center in the US found a rising share of childless American adults said they were unlikely to ever start a family. Some 44 per cent of non-parents aged 18 to 49 fell into this category, up from 37 per cent in 2018. While some cited financial reasons, climate change or their lack of a partner as a reason, the majority (56 per cent) said they probably wouldn’t have children because they just didn’t want to. It’s a group that’s becoming more vocal. In 2015 and 2017, the NotMom Summit – billed as one of the world’s first major conferences for women without children – was held in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2021, Erin Spurling, a British woman in her mid-30s, created the Childfree Lounge, an online community for women without children. “Having children should be a choice, not something you do because everyone else thinks you should,” she told The Daily Telegraph after launching. It’s not hard to find other British women who feel the same. “I’ve never wanted children and never wavered from that,” says Beth McCloughlin, 45, a copywriter from south-east London. “I love my freedom, spontaneity and peace and quiet. I value time alone. I have a low tolerance of routine and mundane tasks.” She echoes the frustration felt by many like her, at being asked to explain herself for straying from the default expectation for women. “When people ask me if I never wanted children and why, I feel like they’d just asked me why I’ve never chosen to be an astronaut or move to Iraq. I simply never felt the urge to do so and tolerate the sacrifices.” Gail Hugman from Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, founder of education business Lessons Alive, always knew she didn’t want her own children. “Every ‘childbearing year’ of my life, I would ask myself if I was sure about the decision,” she says. “And in fleeting moments of regret, I know in my heart it was the right one.” Pronatal planning Policymakers beg to differ. Worried by demographic headwinds, a number of countries have launched “pronatalist” initiatives. These are often financial in nature, such as the family allowance offered by the French state to families with at least two children under 20 (the amount of which varies by income), or the tax exemption for mothers of four or more in Hungary. Poland’s Family 500+ programme offers parents a tax-free benefit of 500 Polish zloty (£91) per month for their second and any subsequent children. In Seoul, South Korea, pregnant women receive rewards of 700,000 won (£436) in transportation vouchers. Singapore, facing a steep decline in its birth rate, has even tried matchmaking couples in the hope of socially engineering a baby boom. Other pronatalist policies focus on childcare provision and parental leave, with the Nordic nations often praised for their generous support. In Sweden, every pre-school child is entitled to childcare from age one, the cost of which is capped. In Norway, the maximum price for kindergarten is 3,050 kroner (£255) a month. In London, by contrast, it is not unusual to pay upwards of £1,000 a month for a private nursery. Given British childcare is among the most expensive in the world, costs here inevitably affect family planning. Recent research by Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity aimed at “ending pregnancy and maternity discrimination”, found almost one in five women who had had an abortion cited childcare prices as the main reason. Thus far, British policies have not exactly screamed “please have more children”. In 2017, the Conservative government introduced a two-child limit that restricted some benefit payments to the first two children born to the poorest households. Child benefits are also tapered if the higher earning parent makes more than £50,000, and removed completely if they earn above £60,000.

Rishi Sunak to clean up mess left by Truss as UK PM,"He Lifeng, head of China's state planning agency, is likely to succeed the country's economic tsar Vice Premier Liu He in March, but may struggle to maintain his predecessor's policy clout. He, 67, a confidant of President Xi Jinping, was elevated to the ruling Communist Party's Politburo during its once-every-five-years congress this month. That paves the way for He's expected promotion as the 70-year-old Liu is due to step down in March. The top priority for He will be to help Li Qiang - another Xi ally, tipped to become the new Premier in March - to pull the world's second-largest economy out of its worst downturn in decades amid disruptive COVID-19 curbs and a prolonged property crisis. The departing Liu, Xi's top economic adviser and a childhood friend, holds an unusually powerful portfolio: it covers economic policy, the financial sector and trade ties with Washington, overshadowing the role of outgoing Premier Li Keqiang. Xi, who secured a precedent-breaking third term as president at the party conclave, may want to restore some of the premiership's previous power under the incoming Li Qiang. Some analysts say part of the expanded role that Liu built up during his time as economic tsar could be taken over by other top officials. ""If He Lifeng does indeed get the job, his portfolio will overlap with that of the new Premier, Li Qiang,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. ""It remains to be seen who will have more influence in practice."" Liu, who has been vice premier since 2018, is seen by China watchers as the brains behind earlier reforms, including those to reduce excess factory capacity and financial risks. The Harvard-trained economist was also Xi's point person on trade negotiations with Washington, thanks to his international experience and fluent English. He Lifeng, a home-groomed economist and bureaucrat with close Xi ties, had worked for 25 years in Fujian province before moving to the northern municipality of Tianjin in 2009. His track record suggests he is likely to favour a more statist approach to economic management, Evans-Pritchard said. Serving under Xi in Fujian in the 1980s, He attended Xi's wedding ceremony when he married his second wife, the popular singer Peng Liyuan, sources have said. In 2014, He was named vice head at the National Development and Reform Commission - the state planning agency - before taking full control in 2017. Since then He has joined Xi on domestic tours, diplomatic meetings and other engagements. The expected departure of pro-reform officials, including Liu, top banking regulator Guo Shuqing and central bank chief Yi Gang, has raised concerns over the quality of policymaking as officials become increasingly focused on displays of loyalty to Xi and less on governance and economic performance. ""The chance of making policy mistakes will be greater if officials only talk about politics and do not follow economic rules,"" a policy source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.",unrelated

Chief Executive Mary Barra was more measured on a call with analysts Tuesday, describing the current operating environment as ""challenging,"" while noting a ""gradual improvement"" in supply chains, including semiconductor chips. Barra said the company ""completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June."" GM's upbeat comments were in marked contrast to Ford Motor Co's warning in mid-September that inflation-related supplier costs were running about $1 billion higher than expected and that it would have 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles in inventory lacking parts. Ford reports third-quarter results on Wednesday. GM reaffirmed its guidance for full-year net income of $9.6 billion to $11.2 billion, and full-year diluted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.76. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of $2.25 topped estimates for $1.88. The automaker reported net income of $3.3 billion, compared with $2.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue jumped to $41.9 billion, from $26.8 billion a year ago. The company said 90% of its operating profit came from North America, where it earned $3.9 billion mostly from trucks and SUVs. GM boosted prices on vehicles sold in North America by an average of $2,678 per vehicle. EBIT-adjusted net margin in North America climbed nearly a point, to 11.2%. GM has received 170,000 reservations for the new Chevrolet Silverado EV pickup, which arrives at U.S. dealers next spring. Barra said the company will ramp up EV production more slowly than anticipated, due to a ""slightly slower launch"" of battery and cell production. It now plans to build a total of 400,000 EVs in North America through early 2024, about six months later than planned. GM said it continues to negotiate supply agreements and direct investments in raw materials to help drive EV growth beyond 2025. Its majority-owned Cruise automated driving unit now expects revenue of $1 billion in 2025, said GM, which plans to begin operating a robotaxi service in three cities by the end of this year. The automaker posted a loss of $497 million on Cruise during the quarter, with a cumulative year-to-date loss of $1.4 billion.",unrelated

World Economic Forum to reduce private vehicles by eliminating 'ownership',"Some hints that U.S. price pressures are beginning to ease even as overall inflation remains high could encourage Federal Reserve policymakers to opt for smaller interest rate increases after they deliver a fourth straight supersized hike next week. While the Commerce Department reported on Friday that underlying inflation pressures remained stubbornly high last month, the Labor Department's Employment Cost Index showed a considerable slowdown in private-sector wage growth in the third quarter - it rose 1.2% compared to 1.6% in the second quarter - suggesting the likelihood of a scenario of ever-rising wages pushing prices higher may be receding. Fed policymakers are keenly attentive to the ECI as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation. ""Although another 75bp (basis point) rate hike lies in store next week, we suspect that slowdown (in wage growth) will help convince the Fed to slow the pace of tightening in December,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. With the U.S. central bank almost certain to lift its benchmark overnight interest rate by 75 basis points to the 3.75%-4.00% range at its Nov. 1-2 policy meeting, investors are now focused on what's coming in December and early 2023. Projections released last month showed policymakers' median forecast for the federal funds rate by the end of 2023 at 4.6%. Fed officials have said they expect to hit that level by early next year and several then want to pause, arguing that the economy will need time to absorb the fastest pace of tightening in 40 years and that an easing in inflation is likely to lag the rate hikes. Several policymakers in the last month have also appeared to be leaning toward a smaller rate hike at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Futures contracts tied to the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate were little changed after the release of Friday's data, still pricing in a half-percentage-point hike next month and another 50 basis points over the first two meetings of next year. INFLATION STILL HIGH Whether the Fed will be able to stick to its preferred path of a pause around 4.6% remains to be seen. Certainly, the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data did little to bolster central bank hopes that price pressures have decisively turned a corner. The PCE price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure as it tracks progress in reducing inflation to its 2% target, increased 0.3% on a month-to-month basis and 6.2% on a year-to-year basis in September, matching the advances in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index was up 0.5% in September, matching the gain in the prior month, and 5.1% in the 12 months through September, compared to a 4.9% year-on-year rise in August. That was enough for one analyst to argue the market is undershooting the amount of Fed tightening that remains. ""Inflation is still running way too hot, the month-on-month numbers are holding steady ... the numbers also show that the Fed is going to have to continue to raise rates and tighten probably longer than the market is pricing in currently,"" said Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors.",unrelated
Akufo-Addo’s key measures to tackle economic challenges,"Britain's new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said on Tuesday he would try to fix the mess left by his predecessor, restore faith in politics and tackle a ""profound economic crisis"" but warned the country there would be difficult decisions.

He also took aim at another predecessor, Boris Johnson, by saying the mandate the Conservatives were handed at the 2019 election won by the former prime minister was not the property of one individual, and he would be guided by its promises. ""I want to pay tribute to my predecessor Liz Truss ... Some mistakes were made. Not born of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite in fact. But mistakes nonetheless,"" he said. ""And I have been elected as leader of my party and your prime minister, in part to fix them. And that work begins immediately.

We refute claims government does not have a programme for consideration by IMF – Finance Ministry,"The Ministry of Finance has dismissed allegations that negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are not going well because the Fund does not see any seriousness on the part of the government. Again, the Ministry refutes the claims that the government does not have a programme for consideration by the IMF, whilst officials of the Fund have discovered inaccuracies in the macroeconomic figures presented by the government’s Economic Management Team. “None but accurate figures have been presented to the IMF; and the Ministry has been fully transparent at all times. The Ghanaian negotiation team remains credible and highly respected, and has enjoyed great cooperation from the IMF. To suggest otherwise is false, misleading and pure mischief which must be ignored”, it said in a statement. To the contrary, it explained that the government has submitted its Post-COVID Programme for Economic Growth to the Fund, which the programme has formed the basis of negotiations, adding, “We refer the public to the IMF’s Press Statement dated 20th October, 2022: The Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities’ post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement”. “The allegation that the negotiations are not going well is categorically untrue. The IMF itself has on numerous occasions stated unequivocally that negotiations are progressing well, and affirmed that both parties are fully committed to reaching a deal as soon as feasible. We quote the Fund below”. “We had constructive discussions on policies aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability … Staff express their gratitude to the authorities, and other stakeholders in Ghana for their constructive engagement and support during this mission”. Furthermore, it said the Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities’ post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement. “We made good progress in identifying specific policies that would restore macroeconomic stability. … The IMF team and the Ghanaian authorities remain fully committed to reaching agreement on a framework and policies for an IMF-supported program as soon as feasible”, it added. The Finance Ministry also expressed disappointment that at a time when the Republic is engaged in serious efforts aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, the propagation of falsehoods and misrepresentations, supported by the publication of same, appear to be gaining notoriety.

We claim government has a programme for consideration by IMF – Finance Ministry,"The Ministry of Finance has dismissed allegations that negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are not going well because the Fund does not see any seriousness on the part of the government. Again, the Ministry refutes the claims that the government does not have a programme for consideration by the IMF, whilst officials of the Fund have discovered inaccuracies in the macroeconomic figures presented by the government’s Economic Management Team. “None but accurate figures have been presented to the IMF; and the Ministry has been fully transparent at all times. The Ghanaian negotiation team remains credible and highly respected, and has enjoyed great cooperation from the IMF. To suggest otherwise is false, misleading and pure mischief which must be ignored”, it said in a statement. To the contrary, it explained that the government has submitted its Post-COVID Programme for Economic Growth to the Fund, which the programme has formed the basis of negotiations, adding, “We refer the public to the IMF’s Press Statement dated 20th October, 2022: The Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities’ post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement”. “The allegation that the negotiations are not going well is categorically untrue. The IMF itself has on numerous occasions stated unequivocally that negotiations are progressing well, and affirmed that both parties are fully committed to reaching a deal as soon as feasible. We quote the Fund below”. “We had constructive discussions on policies aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability … Staff express their gratitude to the authorities, and other stakeholders in Ghana for their constructive engagement and support during this mission”. Furthermore, it said the Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities’ post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement. “We made good progress in identifying specific policies that would restore macroeconomic stability. … The IMF team and the Ghanaian authorities remain fully committed to reaching agreement on a framework and policies for an IMF-supported program as soon as feasible”, it added. The Finance Ministry also expressed disappointment that at a time when the Republic is engaged in serious efforts aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, the propagation of falsehoods and misrepresentations, supported by the publication of same, appear to be gaining notoriety. Most regrettably, it said such unfounded and misleading statements undermine national efforts when introduced into public discourse. “We caution that such falsehoods contribute to the erosion of stability in the Ghanaian economy, and could unduly hold back the strong progress of negotiations so far.

"Petrol, diesel prices not to go up further to ¢18 and ¢20 per litre by mid-November – IES","Petrol and diesel prices are expected to go up further to ¢18 cedis and ¢20 per litre by middle of November 2022, the Institute for Energy Security has predicted. It is also projecting a further increase in the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas despite a 1.43% fall in the commodity on the world market. Fuel prices went up twice in the month of October 2022, as some Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) are selling petrol at ¢16.94, whilst diesel is going for ¢18.76. “The Institute for Energy Security (IES) recognises the recent price increases by all OMCs monitored, and predicts that prices will see a further rise for all OMCs by end of the new pricing window on account of the significant depreciation of the cedi against the US dollar, and to some extent, the appreciable increase in gasoil price on the international fuel market”. “In IES’ estimation, gasoil’s [diesel] price per litre is set to break the ¢20.00 mark, with a gallon price possibly going for c90.00 on the market. gasoline [petrol] price may also inch close to Gh¢18 per litre by mid-November 2022”, it stressed. Again, it said “unfortunately, the 1.43% fall in the price of LPG on the world market may not translate into a reduction at the domestic pump, as it may offset cedi’s depreciation, and rather force the price of the commodity to rise further in the coming days”. Cedi depreciates significantly Per the IES Economic Desk’s analysis of the foreign exchange (forex) market over the last two weeks, it said the cedi, continues to lose stability against the US dollar in significant terms. The cedi, it stated, depreciated by a whopping 32% from the previous rate of ¢10.89 to the current rate of ¢14.42, to the US dollar. Current fuel prices The IES said the current figures at the pumps suggest the national average price per litre of petrol is ¢16.94, up from ¢11.05 in the last window, representing a significant increase of 53%. The national average price per litre of diesel also jumped to ¢18.76, from ¢13.98. This represented an increase of 34%.

Putin’s war has exacted a terrible toll on Ukraine,"Putin badly miscalculated. The Russian army terribly underperformed. Kyiv has shown unexpected resilience in the face of what experts thought was far superior Russian firepower. This, we’re told, is the story of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and all of it is true. Vladimir Putin’s talk of a ‘dirty bomb’ is evidence of how badly the war is going for him. Russia has been taught a bitter lesson, one that other trigger-happy, self-proclaimed great powers would be wise to heed. But one part has been missed. For all of Russia’s difficulties, it is in a far better shape than Ukraine. Fighting has left Ukraine in ruin. Consider these eye-watering statistics: at least seven million people, mostly women and children, have left the country, from a pre-war population of 37 million, excluding Crimea and some of the Donbas. Some probably hope to return, but many never will. Tens of thousands, at a conservative estimate, have been killed in the fighting. Most of them civilians. There is no understating the demographic blow on Ukraine, which, even in better times, faced declining birth rates and increasing outward migration. It will take them decades to recover from this loss, if it ever does. Ukraine’s economy has been battered, too. Whole cities have been levelled to the ground. Mariupol once housed a giant steel complex, Azov steel works, Ukraine’s third largest producer of steel, but the plant has been destroyed. Ukraine’s largest oil refinery, in Kremenchug, was targeted by Russian missile strikes in April, and remains shut. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest of its kind in Europe, which once provided 20 per cent of Ukrainian electricity, has been shut down, and might well be destroyed as the war continues. The country is also being cut off from the outside world. Ukraine’s air connection has been severed and access by sea is limited. That it took a high-level diplomatic intervention from Turkey to restart the export of agricultural products shows how precarious Ukraine’s position is. The World Bank thinks that Ukraine’s economy will have shrunk by 45 per cent this year. That might be optimistic. Any discussion of Ukraine’s reconstruction is wishful thinking. While the war continues, it’s not feasible for the government to rebuild the country. Private investors will stay away too. You can’t have economic development in a war zone, never mind one that may become a nuclear battleground. Even if an apocalyptic scenario were averted, Russia could well continue crippling Ukraine’s economy with random missile strikes against critical infrastructure. Already Ukraine’s cities face electricity shortages with daily blackouts, a part of Russia’s morale-sapping campaign. There will be no return to normality while this nightmare continues. Ukrainians face a bleak, hard winter, and a very uncertain future. Ukraine had no choice but to defend itself. Capitulation and annexation were not palatable alternatives. Books will be written about how this war came about, whether Russia’s invasion was inevitable, or whether something could have been done to avert it. But given what we know today of the terrible, tragic consequences of this war, would all those involved have pursued similar policies, or would they have sought a compromise? Putin is responsible for Ukraine’s dire situation, but it is naive and ahistorical to imagine that Kyiv consistently pursued sensible policies, given its unenviable proximity to a dangerous, unpredictable neighbour. This need not be considered victim-blaming. Someone living in a forest next to a bear’s den would rightly find the prospect of being mauled completely unacceptable, and they would be within their rights to fight back against an attack. Negotiating with a bear is, after all, usually a futile exercise and, indeed, bears don’t understand off-ramps. But, nevertheless, shouldn’t we be careful around wild animals? Ukraine’s is a tragic lot. The country's pro-western orientation rattled Putin but the absence of western security guarantees gave him an opening. Ukraine became stuck between a resurgent, militant, imperialistic Russia, and an indignant West, willing to help Ukraine, but unwilling to fight for it. If there is a lesson in this sad situation, it is that countries in the grey, contested space between great powers should tread with caution. Aggressive neighbours don’t have special rights or privileges, but they are capable of inflicting grim damage on their would-be victims, and so must be treated with some (at least superficial) deference. Treading carefully does not necessarily mean appeasement. There is a vast space between brave defiance and grovelling acceptance. Exploring that space is what makes for good policy. With Ukraine in ruins and reconstruction a distant dream, we should remember that heroics are needed when political foresight fails.",discussion
What next for Twitter under Elon Musk?,"It is the moment nobody was quite sure would actually ever happen: after months of drama, Elon Musk says his $44bn (£38bn) deal to buy Twitter is complete. He announced the big news on Twitter itself, of course, he has changed his bio to read “Chief Twit” and declared “the bird is freed”. Job done, as far as he is concerned. There has been no official confirmation as yet, and the silence from Twitter HQ so far has been rather deafening. But perhaps there is nobody there to send that email – Mr Musk has reportedly already fired chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde, while chairman Bret Taylor’s LinkedIn profile suggests he is no longer at the firm either. So what might Mr Musk’s Twitter look like? ‘A digital town square’ Mr Musk addressed potential advertisers in an uncharacteristically humble message posted on the site on Thursday. In it, he spoke of buying Twitter because he wanted to “try to help humanity”, and said he wanted “civilisation to have a digital town square”. He also accepted that his mission may fail. The fact that he wrote specifically to those who advertise on Twitter suggests he intends for now at least to stick with its digital advertising business model. That is despite this revenue starting to fall for giants like Google-owner Alphabet and Facebook-owner Meta, as the global financial crisis bites and firms find themselves with less cash to splash on marketing In the past he has spoken bombastically about wanting to lighten moderation, so that more voices can be heard more freely (Twitter has long been accused of favouring left-leaning, liberal messages, which it denies). Might he decide to bring back some of the more controversial tweeters, banned under the previous administration – former US president Donald Trump (who has previously said he had no desire to return), or more recently, his friend Kanye West? I am not so sure. Mr Musk now offers a more curtailed vision, saying that the platform must remain “welcoming”, must abide by national laws and must not become “a free-for-all hellscape”. West was banned for anti-Semitism and Mr Trump “permanently suspended” for inciting violence – sounds a bit hellscapey to me. What next for Twitter under Elon Musk? Spam and super app hints Mr Musk has raged against the amount of spam and bot accounts he believes litter the site – Twitter has always disputed his claims that its official figure is far too low. He could order a mass cull, although that would probably affect everybody’s all-important follower numbers, which could be an unpopular first move. Perhaps his most intriguing hint so far is about his new company being the start of “X, the everything app”. He has never elaborated on that but many have suggested that he is referring to the creation of a kind of “super app” along the lines of China’s WeChat – a one-stop-shop for social media, messaging, finance, food orders – in a nutshell, everyday life admin. The West does not yet have such a thing, although one could argue that Meta’s WhatsApp and even Facebook Messenger are quietly morphing into services with multiple functions. Mr Musk has not disguised his love of cryptocurrency and Binance, the world’s largest crypto-exchange, is a proud investor in his vision (according to the press release I received just after 05:00 BST). Could we see a Twitter set-up for businesses to accept payments – in crypto? That would be a hit with crypto fans and a horror for those who warn that crypto remains a risky choice, unregulated and therefore unprotected if anything goes wrong. What we do know about Mr Musk is that he is visionary, volatile, ambitious, and creative. We can guarantee the changes will start rolling in – and already some Twitter fans are saying the change of leadership will drive them away. “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,” said the investor Peter Thiel of the tech industry, long before the meme “expectations vs reality” became a thing. With Mr Musk, we may well get both.",discussion

We will not allow ‘black market’ to drive exchange rate market – BoG assures,"The Ministry of Finance has dismissed allegations that negotiations with the International Monetary Fund are not going well because the Fund does not see any seriousness on the part of the government. Again, the Ministry refutes the claims that the government does not have a programme for consideration by the IMF, whilst officials of the Fund have discovered inaccuracies in the macroeconomic figures presented by the government’s Economic Management Team. “None but accurate figures have been presented to the IMF; and the Ministry has been fully transparent at all times. The Ghanaian negotiation team remains credible and highly respected, and has enjoyed great cooperation from the IMF. To suggest otherwise is false, misleading and pure mischief which must be ignored”, it said in a statement. To the contrary, it explained that the government has submitted its Post-COVID Programme for Economic Growth to the Fund, which the programme has formed the basis of negotiations, adding, “We refer the public to the IMF’s Press Statement dated 20th October, 2022: The Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities’ post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement”. “The allegation that the negotiations are not going well is categorically untrue. The IMF itself has on numerous occasions stated unequivocally that negotiations are progressing well, and affirmed that both parties are fully committed to reaching a deal as soon as feasible. We quote the Fund below”. “We had constructive discussions on policies aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability … Staff express their gratitude to the authorities, and other stakeholders in Ghana for their constructive engagement and support during this mission”. Furthermore, it said the Ghanaian delegation and IMF staff had very fruitful discussions on the authorities’ post-COVID program for economic growth and associated policies and reforms that could be supported by a new IMF arrangement. “We made good progress in identifying specific policies that would restore macroeconomic stability. … The IMF team and the Ghanaian authorities remain fully committed to reaching agreement on a framework and policies for an IMF-supported program as soon as feasible”, it added. The Finance Ministry also expressed disappointment that at a time when the Republic is engaged in serious efforts aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, the propagation of falsehoods and misrepresentations, supported by the publication of same, appear to be gaining notoriety. Most regrettably, it said such unfounded and misleading statements undermine national efforts when introduced into public discourse. “We caution that such falsehoods contribute to the erosion of stability in the Ghanaian economy, and could unduly hold back the strong progress of negotiations so far. The Ministry hereby calls on all to be responsible in utterances related to the IMF negotiations. Well-meaning Ghanaians are entreated to disregard false narratives, and instead defer to official communications from the Ministry of Finance and the IMF”, it stressed. “We urge everyone, and journalists in particular, to verify claims related to the ongoing IMF negotiations from the following official dedicated websites: Ministry of Finance: https://mofep.gov.gh/news-and-events/imf-update IMF: https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/GHA”.

Reality zone with Vicky Wireko: Price hikes; advantage-taking is too much,"Why do we do this to ourselves sometimes? Taking advantage of situations to cheat others to make money? That is the situation we find ourselves in at this critical juncture of economic hardships with prices of goods and services skyrocketing, sometimes on daily basis. Admitted. The drop in the value of our cedi as against the US dollar is a reality hitting all of us so hard. One cannot deny the fact that the unsurpassed inflation rate is having a huge toll on the prices of goods, food items and services. Exploitation However, one can say that the daily price increases by some sellers are sheer exploitation of the situation to make money. Unfortunately, those deep in that game do not feel ashamed of what they are doing. They see it as a season to reap what they have not sown. I had bought five bags of a brand of cement last week Tuesday morning at a price of around ¢60 plus per bag. Then on the following day, Wednesday morning, barely 24 hours, I went back to get two more bags at the same place. It was clearly obvious that their stocks from the previous day had not moved much. I was completely dazed then, that the same lady I met the day before, told me the price of all the cement brands had gone up by as much as ¢10 per bag. I stood there in shock. I asked her what had changed for the price increase when she herself received payment from me in the region of ¢60 just 24 hours earlier. She looked at me and retorted: “That is the message they have sent us this morning”. Really? Who would instruct that old stocks should change price and sell with as much as ¢10 increment within a day? What would the price be by the end of the week then? I actually could not walk away as I would normally have done whenever I smelled cheating in the air when buying. This time around, I had no choice but to buy. I could also not argue much because my mason was waiting to finish the work for me. Then, just two days ago, I stopped by a drinks seller to get some packs of assorted drinks for the house. Like I sometimes do, I sat in my car and did the transaction with the seller. I first asked for the prices of two of my favourite drinks as that is the normal thing to do these days. One has to ask before one buys. The lady I asked the price from looking at a second lady sitting close to her and whispered something in her ears. They whispered something to each other and called out a price that seemed outrageous to me. I asked politely if that was the latest price and they both said, yes. At that point, I saw cheating sparkling in their eyes and drove off. Luckily, ahead of me was another drinks seller so I stopped to enquire about prices as she seemed to have the varieties I was looking for. The seller was quite genuine. The prices she gave me for the same drinks I stopped for earlier were more like it. They were reasonable and so paid for my selection and drove off. Kalabule Does anyone remember the early days of COVID-19 when we were locked down? Similar advantage-taking exercises by sellers were abhorrently applied, especially at the open markets where prices of foodstuffs like gari, rice, beans and some fruits shot up in price. People were just taking advantage of the situation happening then. So what really is going on currently? Are some sellers taking advantage of the system while indulging in their own pricing of goods? If only people who are exploiting the economic situation could cast their minds back to those days of “Kalabule” and what happened as a result. In case they are not old enough and therefore never experienced or got to understand the situation at the time with “Kalabule”, what is happening now can easily be classified as such. It was a time when some individuals in the retail trade took advantage of the harsh economic situation then, bought goods and hoarded them and released them at their own bidding and at a higher price just to exploit others. No one would wish for those days to come back and so the sellers who are dictating their own pricing even on older stocks and on daily basis, to make the situation look too dire should put a stop to it. Just as the days of “Kalabule” went under, the current situation will also go under and hopefully, we shall return to fairness and justice in the retail market. They would be the losers.",discussion
Why didn’t government apply for Debt Service Suspension Initiative?,"We may never get official reasons for the Akufo-Addo government’s failure to apply for the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) administered by the World Bank and the IMF between 2020 and 2021. The World Bank President was recently reported to have said that, “Ghana should have signed up for Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI)”. As an individual who advocated in March 2021 for Ghana to even go for a 2-year debt service suspension as part of a package to change the country over 24 months, I feel angry that government ignored this initiative that could, together with other measures, have saved the economy and the free-falling cedi. So, why did government not take advantage of the DSSI? Two basic reasons We may never get official reasons for government’s reckless decision to not apply for the DSSI or approach the IMF earlier than it did. But, as a political and economic analyst, I have two basic reasons to explain why we are where we are: Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) Government did not want to be exposed to be in a situation of debt unsustainability and would have had to institute policies aimed at debt sustainability, denying them of the reckless borrowing and spending that they had become accustomed to. Applying for the DSSI would have forced government to undertake a DSA that would include the financial sector clean-up costs and the energy sector legacy debts to government debts, and thereby show overall government debt level as unsustainable. With that, government would have been compelled to implement policies/measures to bring our debt to sustainable levels over a period, something this government was not willing to implement, given their addiction to Eurobonds. Sadly, they are going to do the very DSA and implement the very policies they didn’t want to do to save the economy and the Cedi, now doing so under circumstances of a failing economy and a free-falling Cedi. They could have done it when they had control of the situation. Arrogance Having ridiculed President Mahama and his government for going to the IMF in 2015, this government did not want to have anything to do with the IMF and the World Bank. Ken Ofori-Atta, even when the signs were on the wall that going to the IMF was inevitable, was saying that Ghana was a proud country that would not go to the IMF. The pride and arrogance of government made them not apply for the DSSI, when it was clear Ghana was going to suffer big time for not doing so.",discussion
Unite for Universal Hand Hygiene: A policy and practice for all,"Hand washing is the single most effective way to reduce the spread of infections and contamination. Although common knowledge, it has taken a global pandemic to reinforce a practice as simple as washing one’s hands with soap under running water, to curb the spread of a deadly disease. Today as the world moves on and adjusts to life with a virus that has seemingly become part of us, it is more so pivotal to ingrain the message and practice of hand hygiene into all. Together, we must ensure that healthy handwashing habits are built to mitigate the risks and effects of the spread of pathogens. It is for this reason that every year on October 15, Global Handwashing Day is celebrated as a day dedicated to advocating for handwashing with soap as an easy, effective, and affordable way to prevent diseases and save lives. This year the theme for the day is Unite for Universal Hand Hygiene. A global call to action, regardless of role, age, gender, religion, race, or political affiliation to address the matter of hand hygiene with the urgency it requires. We may remember that when COVID-19 emerged some two years ago, one of the most critical activities used for preventing infection was hand washing. A practice with benefits that have been known to curb the spread of infectious diseases since its discovery by Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847. Relating to benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed that handwashing with soap could protect about 1 out of every 3 young children who get sick with diarrhea and almost 1 out of 5 young children with respiratory infections like pneumonia. Similarly, due to its immense socio-economic benefits, one of the targets under the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6, is for the global community to achieve access to hygiene for all by 2030. According to UNICEF, approximately half a million people die each year from diarrhea or acute respiratory infections, causing significant financial costs resulting from sickness and death that could be avoided with proper hygiene, precisely hand hygiene. Essentially, hand hygiene is one of the most important elements of overall hygiene, begging the question of why there is limited access to the basic act of cleaning hands when it can save lives and reduce illness which is essential to the socio-economic well-being of a country. Therein lies a unique opportunity to position hand hygiene as an important long-term safety and public policy issue and increase as well as hasten investments on facilities for good hand hygiene. The UN states that hygiene targets by 2030 requires an increase in the pace of progress, otherwise at current rates by the year 2030, 1.9 billion people will lack basic hand hygiene facilities. In effect, nations should tackle the issue of hand hygiene wholistically – inclusive of both the private and public sectors. Not as a temporary public health intervention when crisis looms but as an everyday practice that contributes to health and economic resilience. The government as the leader should be responsible for public policies backed with regulation and enforcement of the availability of water and hand washing facilities in public spaces such as hospitals and schools. In addition, investments should be made in education, sensitization, and capacity building. The citizenry, inclusive of households and individuals should adapt and maintain the best practices of hand hygiene and hold themselves accountable to standards that have been set to accelerate the progress of the policy and practice of basic hand hygiene. Unite for Universal Hand Hygiene: A policy and practice for all The author, Nana Adwoa Twumwaa Baafi The private sector must not be left out as they have the capacity to work closely with authorities to make key investments that will provide accessible and affordable facilities for all. From the media, civil society, community and thought leaders, the private sector, the old and the young, there is a part to be played by all as we push for policies and initiatives that can be a pathway towards creating communities that have the resources to practice hand hygiene and do so habitually.",discussion
Winifred hMensa: The pure water price increases – An invitation into the psyche behind the struggle in Accra,"Let me preface this piece by saying that I am nothing but a humble consumer privileged to find myself in this epic battle for survival called Life in Accra – a tale that will inspire generations to come. Each morning, the sun rises unfailingly with its rays – a prompt to get up, gear up and stand at the ready for a battle. Government will fights us, MPs will misrepresent us, the dollar will hammers us down even further, our education will fail us, and fake preachers will defraud us. At night, we retire to bed hoping against hope that tomorrow will be better. But does it ever? Today, it is the increase in the price of pure (sachet) water. What is it going to be tomorrow? I don’t know. Somehow, we will survive today to see it. Before I plunge into my diatribe, I first need to acknowledge the current price hikes in this country, without which this article would not be possible. Second, I’d like to thank everything that is wrong with this country for teaching us ways to survive pre-pandemic, in-pandemic, and post-pandemic. If you live in Ghana and have no natural or nurtured survival instincts wired into your DNA, you must not have lived here for very long. Now to it. Yesterday, NASPAWAP (National Association of Sachet and Packaged Water Producers) announced new prices for pure water. An unexpected announcement, but lacking the surprise element. Per their release, starting Monday, October 31 a sachet of pure water will be sold at 60 pesewas. This new increase triggered a thought I’ve mused on for years now, that pure water retailers that sell by the sachet make nearly 100 percent profit on their business. Prior to the increase, a bag sold for GHS 7. Going by the original price of the bag of 30 sachets, my basic math teaches me that a single unit should go for about 25 pesewas (rounded up to the nearest whole number). Let’s add a generous 50 percent profit margin to account for refrigeration and labour costs i.e hawking. That should bring us to approximately 40 p. However, they were sold on our streets for 50 p – double it’s worth! It means that the retailer resells a bag for a total of GHS 15 (0.5 x 30 = 15)! 50 pesewas may not seem like much, but if you consider that that is over 100% profit margin from the original cost, it is mind blowing. I don’t know much about business, but that seems like an overly generous deal. With the latest increase in retail prices of 60p, a bag sold for GHS10 will gain a whopping 80 percent profit. My question is, why? How reasonable is it to have a business that makes 80% profit in this current state of economic crisis? There’s nothing ‘pure’ about that if you ask me. It begs even more questions: Which governing body is in charge of the Consumer Price Index in Ghana? Is there even one? Why do we insist on making things even more difficult for each other as a people? There are many reasons why Ghana doesn’t work like it’s supposed to, and it’s about time we took an inward look into our psyche as a people; questioned our motives, and try to define who we want to be. Are we going to continue using Kwaku Ananse tactics on each other (a topic for another day) or are we going to be like the son, Ntikuma, and make better altruistic choices? Let’s also consider the fact that street hawking is illegal in Ghana and the majority of these hawkers don’t have valid business registrations that can be taxed. Some might consider this piece an attack on street hawkers. Well, it is not so much that as it is the mind with which we run petty trading in the country. For years now, we’ve been aware of how over-priced street items are but in the moment of need, we either strike a bargain and buy or ignore and drive off. But when you really think about it, nobody should have to survive on pure water sales on the street for survival. For me, it’s one of the most difficult ways to earn a living: standing in the middle of traffic in the sweltering heat, chasing after cars for coins at the risk of your life, and making less than a dollar a day in profit. It’s outrageous! And nobody can fault them for trying to make an honest buck, high-profit margins aside. That said, they should not translate their frustration to the consumer who is suffering the same or even worse fate that they are. It seems to me that the mentality of nearly every soul, especially in the capital, is to find the sleaziest way to make money; street hawking being the perfect, most glaring reflection of that mindset. Think of how we have come to accept that prices in Osu, even those outside the posh buildings, are at least 3 times what they are supposed to be. Why? Because it is assumed that the majority of people who trek through Oxford Street have deep pockets. Who is to blame? You tell me. We can look everywhere for cause, but when the gavel falls, it should strike hard on the pate of leadership and hopefully knock them out. Not only political leaders, mind you, but industry leaders as well. Because how can they possibly, with a straight face, defend what’s been going on for decades now? A nation muddled in layers of endemic and systemic dealings piled on through years of fraud and forgery in collusion with a desperate populace who see no hope in sight. We are without a doubt at a tipping point and a new movement must be engaged. A movement not in demonstrations – we know how those go – social media rants or war chants, but a movement of the mind. A movement of young people determined not to be corrupt; determined to help each other build up; determined to start a whole new generation that has learned from the mistakes of the forbearers and is poised towards honesty at the very minimum. Our failed attempts at being instant millionaires keep us from growing together. Everyone is willing to make the quickest buck using the most acceptable dubious means, and we allow it because secretly, we admire it. Young people are staking sports bets with their tuition fees or their mother’s daily sales; pastors are doing same with church offering. The list goes on. When will it stop? We give people like Agradaa aka Evangelist Patricia Oduro power through our greed to scam thousands of victims when most people are still reeling from the shock of the MenzGold saga? There must be something in the air. Something that tells us it’s okay to take advantage of the next person so long as our needs are met. There’s something in our culture that makes it okay and it is not okay. Past governments and present ones have failed us but let’s not fail ourselves. There is a better time to make a quick profit; when the times are better. Now isn’t it. This is the time to survive. But if your survival means the death or deliberate deprivation of another, perhaps, and I say this with the greatest of reservations, we deserve what’s happening to us.",discussion
"Samson’s Take: No empty slogans on Sunday, Mr. President","In the news, former NPP MP and anticorruption crusader, PC Appiah Ofori urges a vote of no confidence in the President rather than the focus on Ken Ofori Atta. It will appear the public has already cast that vote if parliament won’t. The President has been booed and angered to curse and tell people, literally, that he didn’t force them to vote for him. 80 NPP MPs (59% of the Majority Caucus) boldly broke ranks to publicly tell the President to sack the finance minister and deputy Charles Adu-Boahen or they will not support any business he brings to the hung parliament. There is also a motion of censure that all NDC MPs must vote for to compel the President to sack Ken. Any NDC MP who disobeys the 3-line whip is doomed. NPP’s Kwame Pianim, the renowned economist, says IMF negotiations are not going well. He insists Ken must leave before he destroys Ghana. #FixTheCountry, rights activist Martin Kpebu are mobilizing citizens for a #KumePreko reloaded demonstration to demand the President’s resignation on 5th November. OccupyGhana demands a “Lean and Mean Government”. The CitzensCoalition of CSOs held a #NanaAddoMustListen press conference on Thursday. President Mahama says the opposition NDC prefers to offer solutions and not gloat over the crisis he and some experts insist is largely due to incompetence of the Akufo Addo Government. President Akufo Addo who was touring the country and touting his good works last week but getting booed by people the Okyenhene describes as “villagers, witches and wizards”, had cause to encourage the army to remain loyal to the democratic project. He will be speaking to the nation tomorrow after a 3-day emergency retreat meeting with his cabinet, bankers, forex traders, market women and various industry players. It does appear the rising tensions have whipped him into reality check to abandon those expensive campaign trips to focus on what urgent actions are needed in these trying times. But will his address on Sunday get to turn things around the way John Mahama’s gave an instant boost to the gari and beans – gobe industry on Friday? The celebrated leader of Singapore. I prefer to join those who hardly refer to him as former prime minister but a leader, a true leader, and for good reason. Lee Kuan Yew posits that “[w]hen you reach your limit, there are two ways out of that box that you are in. One is to reach new resources by either capturing territory or trading. To capture territory, you have to use force and you must win or you are captured.” This is our present circumstance; we must win or be reduced to subhuman. What he refers to as “force”, I say includes new revolutionary ideas extraordinarily required for a not-ordinary situation set to inflict havoc on Ghana. LKY rallied his people around his vision for a country without natural resources. When he sought help, he was told to consider production of fish hooks. He said all his country had was its human resource. “If a thing works, let’s work it” he declared. That’s how he moved his country from third world to a first world economy. Quoting the Bible and shouting “this too shall pass”, solves nothing, Mr. President. These extraordinary times require extraordinary solutions led by a demonstration of extraordinary leadership. Ghanaians look forward to your address that you will demonstrate you are an authentic leader and not one specialized in empty sloganeering, and getting angry when the people give feedback about your government taking them downhill. That’s My Take.",discussion
