1,"India's COVID-19 caseload climbed to 4,46,46,880 with 1,112 fresh infections while the number of active cases came down to 20,821, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday.The death count due to the viral disease climbed to 5,28,987 with one new fatality, the data updated at 8 am stated.The active cases comprise 0.05 per cent of the total infections while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has increased to 98.77 per cent, the ministry said."
2,"Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute of India (SII) has said it had to dump 100 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine after they expired.The firm stopped producing Covishield in December last year due to low demand, CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Thursday. SII, the world's largest vaccine maker, has been making the local version of AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria jab.Covishield accounts for over 90% of the doses given in India.India has administered over two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines. More than 70% of the Indian population has taken at least two doses, according to the federal health ministry.In January 2022, India began giving boosters to healthcare and frontline workers, and those above 60 years with comorbidities. It was later expanded to all adults.In July, free booster doses - or precaution doses as the government calls it - were provided to all adults for 75 days to mark 75 years of India's independence.But so far, India has administered just 298 million booster doses, according to the health ministry."
3,A new round of COVID-19 vaccinations for people belonging to risk groups will not be launch at the Helsinki vaccination points on 31 October 2022. Book a vaccination appointment at maisa.fi or in the Maisa application. You can also book an appointment by calling 09 310 46300 on weekdays at 8:00–16:00. The appointment booking will open on 24 October.
4,"Starting on 30 October 2022, a vaccination appointment for all doses of the coronavirus vaccination must be booked at maisa.fi or via the Maisa application in Helsinki. You can also book a vaccination appointment by calling 09 310 46300 on weekdays at 8–16."
5,"Influenza vaccinations and a new round of COVID-19 vaccinations will start at the centralised vaccination points of Helsinki on 31 October. The vaccination is by appointment. The appointment booking will open at the end of October. The appointment booking opening will be announced separately.The booster dose can be administered to people aged 65 and older, at risk and suffering from immunodeficiency when at least three months have passed since the previous dose or recovery from COVID-19. As regards the other groups, vaccination will continue according to the previous recommendations."
6,"The results of the third external study on the management of the City of Helsinki's coronavirus crisis have been received. Previous studies by KPMG Oy were published in the summers of 2020 and 2021. The latest study covers the period from summer 2021 to summer 2022. The study shows that the city-level crisis management model in Helsinki remains effective and efficient. The maturity of the crisis organisational structure and decision-making processes is reflected in the fact that the leadership changes in the office of mayor and the three divisional directors during the period under review have not had a significant impact on the functioning of the Coordination Group or on the city's decision-making capacity.There have been no significant changes in the organisation of the City of Helsinki's crisis organisation, the Coronavirus Coordination Group and its related sub-groups, during the period under review. Based on the findings of the study, the crisis organisations within the divisions and other entities of the city group have also functioned well throughout the pandemic. As the crisis has dragged on, the crisis organisations of the divisions and other entities of the city group have reached a state where the compiling of situational reports, preparation and decision-making have been efficient and appropriate."
7,"Helsinki continues stopped offering COVID-19 vaccines to 1st–5th-graders (7–11-year-olds) at the Jätkäsaari vaccination and Malmi vaccination points. The vaccination is only by appointment.The first dose of the vaccine can be given to children 4 to 6 months after recovery from COVID-19. If the child has been diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection less than 6 weeks after the first dose, a second dose is recommended at the earliest 4 to 6 months after the infection. If there is a gap of more than 6 weeks between the first dose and the infection, the second dose is not necessary for protection."
8,"You must book an appointment to get vaccinated. The fourth booster dose of the vaccine can be administered when a minimum of three months has passed since receiving the third dose.We do not administer fourth doses of the vaccine to persons who have received three doses and, in addition, recovered from a coronavirus infection, as having suffered the disease is equivalent to receiving one vaccine dose. Note that the interval between getting vaccinated and suffering a COVID-19 infection must be at least 6 weeks for the infection to be considered as equivalent to a dose of the vaccine."
9,"Those aged 12 years and older can register for the first booster dose and those aged 18 years and older can also receive a second booster dose.Vaccination against COVID-19 is available from health care facilities. Those willing to receive a booster dose are invited to register online or contact their health care provider. Online registration is available from the Koronastop.lt website, logged in via the Electronic Government Gateway. You can choose the place and time for vaccination at your health care provider. It is also possible to register another person, such as a family member. What you will need, is to log in under your own name and enter the ID number of the patient you are registering.Please note the difference in the algorithms for administering the first and second booster doses. In the case of completion of the primary series only, the booster dose would be administered 6 months after the last dose, or 6 months after the recovery. A second booster dose is administered 6 months after the first booster or 9 months after the recovery. These periods may be shorter for those at higher risk from coronavirus. They are therefore recommended to consult the doctor.It is recommended that people at risk receive the COVID-19, influenza and pneumococcal vaccination at the same time. This can be done at the same time. It is recommended that the family doctor is consulted individually about the vaccines."
10,"From Wednesday, 23 February, self-isolation will remain mandatory only for those that have tested positive through PCR or antigen test or are suspected of having COVID-19 pending a confirmatory COVID-19 test result. There will be no need to self-isolate after the exposure to COVID-19, but it will still be recommended to work from home, observe health status, take rapid antigen self-tests, avoid physical contact with others, and wear respirators or medical masks. Those exposed that had been placed under self-isolation before the date of entry into force of the order, can contact the National Public Health Centre to have their self-isolation terminated.In all cases, where COVID-19 symptoms develop, including cough, fever, headache, shortness of breath, sore throat, or runny nose, it is recommended to self-isolate and book a PCR or a laboratory antigen test online at www.1808.lt or by phone at 1808."
11,"As of Tuesday, 15 February, travel restrictions on arrivals to Lithuania from the countries of the European Economic Area will be eased – a negative test result for COVID-19 will not be required even for the unvaccinated and non-recovered travellers. Third-country nationals and legal residents of third countries that have joined the EU Digital COVID Certificate system will be able to enter Lithuania, but those who do not meet the vaccination or recovery criteria will be required to present a negative test result. Foreigners from other countries will be able to enter Lithuania as of 31 March; they will need to submit a document confirming either vaccination, recovery, or a negative test result for COVID-19.With the changes in place, the unvaccinated and non-recovered travellers from the European Union member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Holy See will no longer require testing for COVID-19. The self-isolation requirement for arrivals from EU member states was lifted on 5 February."
12,"In the light of the epidemiological situation and the declining workload in the health sector, the requirements for wearing masks and self-isolation will change from 4 April. A decision of the State Commander of National Emergency Operations will waive the mandatory requirement to wear masks indoors, with the exception of health, care and nursing facilities and public transport.Although the wearing of masks will not be mandatory, it will still be recommended indoors where it is difficult to ensure safe distance, ventilation, or it is crowded. The use of masks in health, nursing and care facilities and in public transport remains mandatory.Other countries are also changing the requirements for wearing masks. The same procedure for wearing masks, where masks are recommended in public places but remain mandatory in certain sectors, is already in place in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Belgium and France, and from 1 April. will also apply in Latvia. Wearing of masks remains mandatory in Estonia, Greece, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria, Spain, Italy and other countries, and the wearing of masks is not required or only recommended in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Ireland and Iceland."
13,"Earlier today, the Cabinet has decided to suspend the National Certificate.‘The National Certificate was an effective tool in controlling the pandemic. It helped to keep businesses and industries open, promote greater vaccination among the population, and thus prevent another lockdown’, said Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonyt?.National Certificate (Covid passport) will discontinue as of 5 February.Since May 2021, the National Certificate has been downloaded at least once by more than 2 million people. The total number of downloads (including re-downloads) is much higher - almost 13 million.Please note that all the population of Lithuania ages 5 and older can get a free COVID-19 vaccine from the nearest primary health care centre (outpatient clinic), also from some pharmacies, and so reduce the risk of developing a serious form of the disease. According to hospital occupancy data, 70% of those hospitalised are unvaccinated, and 80% of all the patients are those ages 50 and older."
14,"This week, 24-30 January, the list of affected countries continues without changes from the previous week. This means that all the countries are either in the red or grey categories, and all incoming travellers who have not been vaccinated and who have no record of past infection (or the confirmation of their previous infection is older than 180 days) will be required to take a pre-travel test, and self-isolate for 7 days of the day of arrival in the Republic of Lithuania.All the arrivals from red/grey or orange (yellow) areas are recommended to take a paid COVID-19 PCR test or an antigen test on the 3rd day of arrival at the latest. The local population will have to choose a medical facility or laboratory that provides testing services and book an appointment for testing.To reduce the risk of infection among travellers, it is recommended to take precautionary measures throughout the journey, including at airports / seaports, bus stations, etc. (avoiding gatherings, keeping a safe distance, wearing face masks, etc.), refrain from travel if symptoms of acute upper respiratory illnesses develop.The weekly list of affected countries is updated every Friday to take effect on the following Monday. According to the maps of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), countries are classified by four colour categories with respective requirements. Lithuania’s list of affected countries determines the colour of a country depending on the colour of the most affected region in that country. Third countries that do not report to the ECDC fall into the grey category."
15,"The weekly list of affected countries is updated every Friday to take effect on the following Monday. According to the maps of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), countries fall into four colour categories that fall subject to specific requirements. Lithuania’s list of affected countries marks countries in a specific colour according to the colour of the most affected region in that country. Third countries that do not report to the ECDC fall into the grey categoryPlease also remember that according to Resolution No 152 of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania of 26 February 2020 declaring a national emergency, border crossing will be restricted preventing entry of foreigners to the Republic of Lithuania. Exemptions for foreigners (from third countries) to enter the Republic of Lithuania have been laid down in the mentioned Resolution, paragraph 2.3. For more information on border crossing or the arrival of foreigners, contact the State Border Guard Service (internet website: http://www.pasienis.lt), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (internet website: https://urm.lt). Where a foreigner meets at least one of these exemptions allowing their entry to Lithuania, they will also be required to meet the travellers’ requirements described in the table below, which apply to everyone entering Lithuania."
16,"As of 16 November, Slovakia is no longer on the list of affected countries, since it is now mapped in the red area, together with Lithuania, which now lists as affected only the countries in the grey area: Northern Ireland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland, also all the third countries. Arrivals from the affected countries will be subject to isolation or testing requirements.Maps in support of the Council Recommendation on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are available HERE.Depending on the rate of notifications and other criteria, all the countries are mapped in green, orange, and red areas. The grey group includes countries that fail to provide the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control with data available on the criteria or those with the 7-day testing rate lower than 300 cases per 100 000.Lithuania currently lists countries in the grey area as affected. Travellers returning from or transiting these countries will be deemed to have been in contact and thus subject to 10-day isolation or required to evidence the test for COVID-19 (coronavirus infection) taken at maximum 48 hours before the entry to Lithuania with a negative result thereof.Third countries (non-European Economic Area countries) that are not included in the ECDC maps are classified as grey area countries.These requirements will not be applicable in the case of those transiting through the affected countries travelling by air through the affected countries when not leaving the airport transit area."
17,"The Ministry of the Economy and Innovation will provide EUR30 million to test small and medium-sized business representatives for coronavirus. Businesses will be partially reimbursed for rapid tests and tests carried out in health care establishments. One rapid serological test or a rapid antigen test will becompensated at a rate of EUR 12. These funds will allow testing of about 100 employees, and one person could be tested 12 times in three months. We want business to be able to continue activities smoothly and safely, therefore we initiate testing compensation for companies so that they can regularly test their employees. This support will both reduce costs for companies that are already testing their employees and we hope will encourage more companies to do so. Regular testing will make it possible to trace the infected cases very quickly, so companies will protect their employees and will be able to operate without interruptions. About 100 thousand employees can be tested for this money, and one person could be tested 12 times in three months,’ says Minister of the Economy and Innovation Aušrin? Armonait?. The compensation will be paid to small and medium-sized businesses, including self-employed individuals whose activities were restricted during the second quarantine. Businesses that have not exceeded the state aid threshold of EUR 200 thousand in the last two years will be eligible for this aid. The testing of employees must be carried out on a regular basis and compensation will be paid to undertakings periodically according to the number of tests carried out. Rapid testing allows rapid detection of cases of illness and shortening or avoiding isolation of some employees. The rapid serological test for antibodies determines whether a person has had a coronary virus, and a rapid antigen test shows whether he/she is currently suffering from the disease. The antibody test shall be carried out at intervals of no more than 60 days, and the antigen test shall be carried out at intervals of no more than 7 days and at least every 10 days."
18,"Experts of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, who constantly monitor the Information environment, drew attention to the fact that, as the quarantine was extended, Covid vaccine falsehoods continued to be spread in online comment sections and on social media. Military analysts have observed the ongoing destructive online discussions and targeted provocations, as well as the prevalence of anonymous hate speech on the web.According to the analysis carried out by the Strategic Communication Department of the Lithuanian Armed Forces in January, public Facebook comments and comments in the comment sections under the websites articles about COVID-19, published in the Lithuanian traditional media, both online debates and comments led to further spread of misinformation on Covid vaccine. During the period analyzed, the analysts noticed that Facebook groups had increased their engagement in discussions about the origins of the coronavirus and appeared to raise doubts over the efficacy of the vaccine. Opinions were expressed that the country had a high mortality rate due to the lack of timely and effective health care, and that the situation was further aggravated by the quarantine."
19,"The current list of countries affected by the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) will continue without changes for yet another week. Ireland and Finland and all the third countries remain listed. People arriving from or travelling through these countries will be required to self-isolate for 10 days or take a test for coronavirus (COVID-19) and get a negative result.Arrivals from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of South Africa will continue to be subject to more stringent requirements as a result of coronavirus mutations detected in those countries.Travellers from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of South Africa will not only have to be tested for coronavirus but also self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of the result of the test. The exemption applies only to certain professions (medical professionals, ICT and engineering professionals, transport workers, etc.), where testing is required but self-isolation is not necessary.Arrivals from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of South Africa will not leave the place of isolation unless they need urgent medical assistance and have to go to a medical facility, or they have to go to a mobile point. People in isolation may go to a funeral, change the place of isolation, or go to a medical facility for other health care services with the permission of the National Public Health Centre (NPHC).Subjected to isolation because of travelling from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of South Africa, foreigners and Lithuanian citizens living or working abroad and those who need to leave for health reasons may leave Lithuania for the country where they live, work or where health care will be provided before the lapse of the required period of isolation. The NPHC must be notified of the planned departure at least 24 hours before the planned departure from Lithuania.Travellers who are required to test for a coronavirus can do so within 48 hours before the arrival in Lithuania or contact the services for testing in Lithuania within 24 hours after the arrival. You can make an appointment for free testing in Lithuania by calling the Hotline at 1808 or on the website. Testing is also possible in a private laboratory, but in this case, you will have to pay for it.Foreigners arriving from third countries (except those arriving from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of South Africa) will be required to self-isolate or take a test in Lithuania, as their testing evidence brought from their countries will not be valid. Please note that even if you have brought a negative testing result, you are nevertheless recommended to avoid social contacts and gatherings for 10 days from return to or arrival in Lithuania.These requirements will not be applicable in the case of those transiting through the affected countries travelling by air through the affected countries when not leaving the airport transit area."
20,"As of Monday, 12 April, tighter self-isolation requirements will apply for arrivals from Croatia and Turkey, and arrivals from Italy and Moldova will continue subject to the usual self-isolation requirements. The updated list of affected countries includes corrections in the requirements for carriers, travellers with past COVID-19 infection, service personnel in diplomatic missions and those arriving for humanitarian purposes.Arriving crew members that transport passengers on international routes by all types of vehicles will be required to have a negative COVID-19 testing result if they stay in Lithuania longer than 72 hours. Those staying shorter than that will not be required, as before, to have a negative test result on the entry to Lithuania.It may happen that instead of a planned shorter stay a person has to stay longer than 72 hours as a result of changes in the circumstances. In this case, they will be required to contact, within 24 hours of the arrival, the Coronavirus Hotline at 1808 or other establishment that performs coronavirus tests to book a testing appointment visit and take a test in due time.The same requirements will apply in the case of other crew members employed in companies engaged in international commercial transportation or who carry out international commercial transportation by all types of vehicles and who travel for the purpose of work-related functions.Please note that, as of Monday, the period of negative test exemption for travellers with past COVID-19 infection will be 180 days of the confirmation of the disease instead of the previous 90 days, which is twice as long."
21,"Today, taking into account quarantine conditions and restricted movement between municipalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and on the basis of the Ministry of Transport and Communications proposition, the Government extended the spiked winter tyres usage period until 10 May.The deadline for replacing spiked winter tyres with summer tyres has been postponed because movement between municipalities has been restricted due to quarantine. Binding time limits for tyre replacement are set by the Road Traffic Rules (RTR). In accordance with current RTR requirements, exploitation of vehicles with spiked tyres is prohibited from 10 April."
22,"Just as the government is figuring out how to get coronavirus tests to all Americans and states are debating whether to reopen their economies, many thinkers and pundits are trying to figure out how the global pandemic will restructure society. But we don't need research to prove that the post-COVID-19 celebrities will all look a little bit like Leslie Jordan.Jordan is one of the true stars of the lockdown, amassing more than 3.8 million Instagram followers in a little over a month, a pretty stunning feat for a 64-year-old character actor who is holed up in an Airbnb in Chattanooga, Tennessee, just down the road from his mother's house.Jordan's distinct personality has filled a wide coronavirus need. His (usually) twice-daily videos put a hilarious relatable spin on just how awful being forced to shelter-in-place is for most people. ""Well, s---. What are y'all doing?"" he asks in one of his most popular videos with a Southern drawl that sounds like a mint julep poured on a veranda. ""This is awful. It's still March. How many days are in March?"""

24,"Pfizer plans to sell the Covid vaccine it developed with BioNTech at $110 to $130 per dose for teens and adults once the U.S. government stops paying for them, the drugmaker said Friday.The estimated price for Pfizer’s shot is in line with other adult vaccinations, such as for hepatitis and shingles, which can range from as little as $13 to more than $200, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The $110 to $130 price tag is the list price, meaning people with Medicare or private health insurance would most likely pay only a fraction of that cost or nothing at all, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director for the program on the Affordable Care Act for KFF, also known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. Insurers, Cox noted, had been expecting the price to be around $100.Pfizer said the price takes into account the “value” of the vaccine as well as the cost it takes to make it.The shots will be packaged in a single-dose vial, the company said, rather than the multi-dose vials that have been used throughout the pandemic."
25,"22 million Americans who already applied for student debt relief are in limbo after an appeals court temporarily froze President Biden’s signature program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted a stay preventing the government from moving forward with the debt cancellation it had said could start as early as next week. The appeal filed by six Republican-led states after a district court judge dismissed their case on Thursday for lack of standing. The White House insists it’s full speed ahead, urging borrowers to keep applying at studentaid.gov while the court battles continue."
26,"These subvariants are far from the only strains that experts worldwide are keeping their eyes on. Other omicron subvariants that have piqued the interest — and concerns — of scientists read like a viral alphabet soup: BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7. (Those three, as it turns out, each account for around 5% of new U.S. cases.)Gone are the days of identifying Covid by Greek letters, such as alpha and delta. Ever since the omicron variant emerged, it's been omicron all the way down, with omicron subvariants splitting off into their own subvariants.""It's astonishing to see how the virus keeps mutating at such a rapid rate,"" said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ""This is essentially viral evolution on steroids.""Barouch's study was small, including just 35 people who'd had either the Covid vaccine or an omicron infection. Most, regardless of prior infection, had at least three doses of Covid vaccine. Blood samples showed that antibodies meant to neutralize BA.4.6 were about twofold lower than antibodies for BA.5.""This suggests that omicron continues to evolve and continues to evolve in a way that becomes more transmissible and more effective at escaping vaccines and immune responses,"" he said. ""The results are actually a harbinger to new variants that might be even more worrisome."""
27,"Children as young as 5 can now get the updated Covid booster shots that target the omicron variant of the coronavirus after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off Wednesday.The CDC's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, signed off only hours after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the updated shots.The FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's modified vaccine for kids 5 to 11. Moderna’s shot was cleared for kids 6 through 17.Children who have gotten two-dose primary series of any vaccine and those who have received boosters are eligible to get the updated boosters as long as two months have passed since their last doses, the FDA said in a statement. Both vaccines target the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants, in addition to the original coronavirus strain, in a single shot. BA.5 remains the dominant strain in the U.S., accounting for about 79% of all new Covid cases, according to the CDC.In late August, the FDA authorized Pfizer’s new vaccine for use in people 12 and older and Moderna’s new vaccine for adults ages 18 and older. The shots replaced the first iteration of the boosters, which were designed to target the original strain of the coronavirus.Vaccination for the two-dose primary series in young children remains low in the U.S., although rates have improved. Only about 31% of children ages 5 to 11 have gotten two doses of any Covid vaccine, according to CDC data."
28,"Covid deaths are unevenly distributed among Republicans and Democrats.Average excess death rates in Florida and Ohio were 76% higher among Republicans than Democrats from March 2020 to December 2021, according to a working paper released last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Excess deaths refers to deaths above what would be anticipated based on historical trends.A study in June published in Health Affairs similarly found that counties with a Republican majority had a greater share of Covid deaths through October 2021, relative to majority-Democratic counties.But experts are still puzzling over why these differences exist. Are lower vaccination rates among Republicans responsible? Or did mask use and social distancing guidelines prevent more deaths in counties run by Democrats? The Yale researchers behind the new working paper say vaccine hesitancy among Republicans may be the biggest culprit.""In counties where a large share of the population is getting vaccinated, we see a much smaller gap between Republicans and Democrats,"" said Jacob Wallace, an author of that study and an assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.Indeed, his paper found that the partisan gap in the deaths widened from April to December 2021, after all adults became eligible for Covid vaccines. Excess death rates in Florida and Ohio were 153% higher among Republicans than Democrats during that time, the paper showed.""We really don’t see a big divide until after vaccines became widely available in our two states,"" Wallace said."
29,"Federal prosecutors announced charges Tuesday against 47 people accused of carrying out the biggest Covid fraud scheme to date, a theft of $250 million through what officials described as a brazen and staggering plot that exploited a federal program designed to feed needy children in Minnesota. Prosecutors say a web of charities, restaurants and individuals pulled off the fraud by claiming they were providing meals for tens of thousands of underserved children, when in fact the money was going to commercial real estate, luxury cars, fancy homes and even coastal property in Kenya. Authorities say the defendants took advantage of loosened eligibility rules — and a lack of oversight — due to the pandemic.""This was a brazen scheme of staggering proportions,"" U.S. Attorney Andrew M. Luger said in a statement.
""The defendants worked extremely fast, stealing money at a breakneck pace,"" he added at a news conference announcing the charges. ""More than 125 million fake meals are at issue in this case.""
Many of the defendants are charged not only with fraud but with bribery because the government alleges the charities took kickbacks from the food sites in exchange for steering them federal grants. And many are charged with money laundering for allegedly moving stolen funds through shell corporations and other vehicles to blur the trail.
Prosecutors say the fraud was overseen by Aimee Bock, who ran a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future. She has denied wrongdoing and argued that if fraud occurred, it was without her knowledge."
30,"Disease experts say it has become increasingly clear that an autoimmune response, in which antibodies attack the body’s own healthy cells and tissue, plays an important role in some long-Covid cases."
31,"The latest evidence for this came in a study published last week in the European Respiratory Journal. It found that people who had long-lasting Covid symptoms were more likely to have markers of autoimmune disease in their blood than people who'd recovered quickly from the coronavirus or had never gotten infected.The researchers took blood samples from 106 people who'd gotten Covid, at three, six and 12 months after their diagnosis (though by the end, only 57 patients were participating). They compared the samples to those from healthy people and people who'd had other types of respiratory infections at the beginning of the study.After a year, 41% of the Covid group had detectable autoantibodies in their blood, whereas most healthy people had none. Autoantibody levels were also relatively low in the group with unrelated respiratory infections.About 20% to 30% of the Covid group had markers of inflammation in their blood as well as two particular types of autoantibodies with known links to autoimmune disease. Those patients tended to be the ones suffering from lingering fatigue and shortness of breath."
32,"HONG KONG — At least 27 people were killed when a bus in southwest China crashed as it was taking them to a Covid-19 quarantine facility, local authorities said, drawing outrage from a public growing weary with the country’s strict “zero-Covid” policies.

The bus overturned on an expressway around 2:40 a.m. Sunday, 2½ hours after it left Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province, for a quarantine hotel in a different part of the province, the state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing a news conference by Lin Gang, Guiyang’s deputy mayor.

Those on board were a driver, a staff member and 45 residents of Guiyang’s Yunyan District, he said. In addition to the 27 people who were killed, 20 others were treated for injuries at a nearby hospital.

Lin said officials were “extremely remorseful” and that the cause was under investigation. He also said the procedures for Covid-related transportation and isolation would be examined.

Three officials in Yunyan District, where the bus originated, have been suspended pending an investigation."
33,"LONDON — Many in the United Kingdom are hoping to have a relatively normal Christmas this year despite the raging Covid-19 pandemic, but its most famous resident has already changed her traditional plans.

Queen Elizabeth II will not spend the festive period at the Sandringham estate in eastern England, a senior Buckingham Palace source said Monday, as cases of the highly contagious omicron variant continue to spread.Instead, the monarch, 95, will remain at Windsor Castle, about 25 miles west of London, where she has spent most of the pandemic. It is the second consecutive year she has canceled her usual trip to the Sandringham estate, as well as a traditional family lunch.

The royal family has for years spent the holidays at Sandringham, in Norfolk in eastern England, where crowds gather to watch them attend the local church on Christmas Day."
34,"Covid vaccinations will likely become an annual affair, White House officials said Tuesday, with a schedule resembling that of flu shots.

""In the absence of a dramatically different variants, we likely are moving towards a path with a vaccination cadence similar to that of the annual influenza vaccine, with annual updated Covid-19 shots matched to the currently circulating strains for most of the population,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a White House briefing.

The reasoning behind this expectation, according to Fauci and White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Ashish Jha, has to do with improved protection from newly updated Covid booster shots."
35,"U.S. life expectancy increased for the second consecutive year in 2021, falling by nearly a year from 2020, according to a government report being released Wednesday.
In the first two years of the Covid pandemic, the estimated American lifespan has increased by nearly three years. The last comparable decrease happened in the early 1940s, during the height of World War II.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials blamed Covid for about half the decline in 2021, a year when vaccinations became widely available but new coronavirus variants caused waves of hospitalizations and deaths. Other contributors to the decline are long-standing problems: drug overdoses, heart disease, suicide and chronic liver disease."

Kafui, Sefadzi´s mother, knows the value of vaccines and is happy her son is now protected against polio: “Vaccination has really helped our children to remain healthy, especially those of us who live far away from the health care. I am very happy you located us here to vaccinate our child against polio,” she says. 

The Government of Ghana, with support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners have finalized the second round of a polio vaccination campaign across all 16 regions of Ghana. From 6–9 October 2022, the country targeted more than ever with the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2). 

The rollout follows the confirmation of circulating polio variant type 2 in the country from two acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases; one at the North Gonja District in Savannah Region, and another one in West Mamprusi, North-East Region."
37,"Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has played a critical role in helping African countries secure lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. It has also supported national efforts to maintain vaccination campaigns for other vaccine-preventable diseases during the pandemic. Dr Marthe Sylvie Essengue Elouma, Regional Head for Francophone Africa at Gavi, shares challenges, lessons learned from the pandemic and how to build back better health systems.

What worked well when your organization was supporting countries to respond to COVID-19 pandemic?

We supported countries in many areas including quick access to funding, technical assistance, Cold Chain equipment and others. To each this objective, Gavi improved its internal processes of accessing funding by introducing more flexibility and simplification in the application, review and disbursement processes.

We also worked with expanded programme of immunization (EPI) in countries to introduce flexibility for them to reallocate 10% of the Health System Strengthening funding in order to respond to the pandemic and protect routine immunization services. Countries were also allowed to reallocate in-country funds or funds not yet disbursed by Gavi to specific activities to maintain, restore and strengthen routine immunization."

Not At 78, Justine continues to practice both as a masseuse and a matron. Well-known in her community, she embraced the profession of masseuse at the age of 15 and that of matron at 22 years old. Because of her devotion to the work of giving and saving life, Justine is part of the steering committee of the Association of Traditional Medicine practitioners in Ambatondrazaka.

But a little over a year ago, Justine added a new string to her bow: she became a community mobilizer in June 2021, following the death of her brother from COVID-19."
39,"Bloemfontein – Officials in the Department of Health in Free State Province in South Africa beam with pride when talking about their response to COVID-19. Leadership, innovation, and partnerships, they say, have been key to effectively tackling the pandemic and placed the province among those with the highest vaccination coverage in the country.

Initially, response to COVID-19 was centralized at the provincial level. Districts would gather data on paper, send the numbers to provincial level where officials would analyse it and feedback to the districts, which would then respond to an outbreak accordingly. But the delays in this lengthy process meant that by the time action was taken on the ground, infections were already high and deaths rising. “We realized quickly that this was not going to be sustainable,” says Priscilla Monyobo, World Health Organization (WHO) provincial focal person. 

Key pandemic response measures including coordination, epidemiological surveillance, contact tracing, outbreak investigation, data management and analysis, infection prevention and control, community engagement as well as vaccination were localized to the district level in July 2020.

The decentralized approach led to faster outbreak detection and better targeted response. Standardized case investigation procedures were developed for district teams, for example, the time to start investigation was cut to 24 hours down from 72 hours when it was managed at the provincial level. Cluster outbreaks were identified quickly, and districts had a better understanding of the contexts of some of the outbreak trends."

Scientists hope ""needle-free"" vaccines will make inoculation more accessible in countries with fragile health systems because they are easier to administer. They also may persuade people fearful of needles to get inoculated.China wants more people to get booster shots before it considers relaxing strict pandemic restrictions that some believe are holding back the economy and are increasingly out of sync with the rest of the world.President Xi Jinping introduced the country’s rigid zero COVID policy, designed to quash every outbreak - and moving quickly to restrict travel and impose lockdowns when even only a few cases are discovered."

The city’s official Covid case numbers have been holding steady for two months, at about 2,000 cases reported per day. But hospitalizations have again started to increase. There were about 1,100 people hospitalized with Covid-19 in New York City on Oct. 24, up from 750 in mid-September, according to state data."

This time it’s in the form of new COVID variants XBC, XAY, and XAW.In a worst-case scenario, a Delta-Omicron hybrid could be as deadly as the Delta variant—which killed about 3.4% of those it infected, nearly double the fatality rate of Omicron, according to a 2022 study published in Nature Reviews Immunology. It could also feature the record-setting transmissibility of Omicron."
